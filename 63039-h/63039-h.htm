</div>

<p class='c006'>This is the sixth volume of the <span class='sc'>Journal</span> of the Society. It continues
the series so auspiciously begun years ago and which has been
added to annually. These six volumes represent a great amount of
work and contain a vast deal of historical material relative to the
Irish element in the composition of the American people. As we
progress with our researches, even we ourselves are quite astonished
at the facts brought to light, facts showing in a far greater degree
than anticipated, how tremendously important was the part taken
by the Irish element in American colonial life and in the early and
subsequent career of the republic itself. The present volume sets
forth much matter of interest and value in this regard, and is in
every way a worthy companion for the volumes of the <span class='sc'>Journal</span>
that have preceded it.</p>

  <h2 id='THE' class='c005'>THE ANNUAL MEETING AND DINNER, A. D. 1906.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The annual meeting and dinner of the Society took place at the
Hotel Manhattan, 42d Street and Madison Avenue, New York City,
on Thursday evening, January 18, 1906. Preceding the meeting a
reception was held, during which the members and guests from various
cities and states exchanged greetings and congratulated each
other upon the continued success of the organization.</p>

<p class='c007'>The annual meeting was called to order by Hon. John D. Crimmins
of New York City, president-general of the Society.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thomas Hamilton Murray of Boston, Mass., secretary-general of
the organization, recorded the minutes of the meeting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Crimmins delivered an address of welcome and felicitated the
Society upon its usefulness and good work in the cause of historical
truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was voted that, in order to save time, the reading of the records
of the preceding meeting be omitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The annual reports of the secretary-general and the treasurer-general
were then presented, and were accepted and adopted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Appropriate action was taken on members of the Society who had
died during the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Edward J. McGuire of New York City, paid an eloquent
tribute to the late Francis C. Travers of the Society. Mr. Travers
was one of the leading New York members of the organization and
always took an active interest in advancing its interests and welfare.</p>

<p class='c007'>The list of officers nominated by the executive council to serve the
Society for the ensuing year, was presented and was unanimously
elected, the secretary-general being authorized to cast one ballot for
the same. (The ticket is set forth on pages <a href='#Page_5'>5</a> and <a href='#Page_6'>6</a> of this volume.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the result of the election being announced, Hon. Franklin
M. Danaher of Albany, N. Y., the newly-chosen vice-president-general,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>took the chair, in the absence of Admiral McGowan, the new
president-general.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judge Danaher thanked the members for the honor bestowed upon
him, and delivered a brief address along the Society’s line of work.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the meeting attention was called to the movement to erect a
monument in Washington, D. C., to Commodore John Barry, and the
active interest of the members of the Society was urged in behalf of
the project.</p>

<p class='c007'>After thanks had been extended the retiring officers for their services
to the Society, several new members were elected and the meeting
adjourned.</p>

<h3 class='c008'><span class='sc'>The Annual Dinner.</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Upon the adjournment of the business meeting, the members and
guests proceeded to the banquet hall of the Manhattan for the
annual dinner. Judge Danaher presided and seated on his right and
left, among others, were: the retiring president-general, Hon. John
D. Crimmins; Hon. Joseph T. Lawless of Norfolk, Va.; Michael
F. Dooley, of the Union Trust Company, Providence, R. I.; Hon.
John Hannan, mayor of Ogdensburg, N. Y.; Hon. John F. Finerty,
Chicago, Ill., and other prominent gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c007'>After grace had been said, the company began a practical discussion
of the elaborate menu prepared for the occasion. Among those
present were the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>The after-dinner exercises were of unusual interest, Judge Danaher
presiding, as he had over the dinner, and the various events on
the program being most enjoyable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leading paper of the evening was by Hon. Joseph T. Lawless
of Norfolk, Va., whose subject was “Gen. Daniel Morgan of the
Revolution.” It was a very able production and was highly appreciated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Willis B. Dowd of New York City, read a paper on the “Early
Irish Settlers of North Carolina,” showing much research on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>part, and being a valuable contribution to the historical papers of
the Society.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were also addresses by Hon. John F. Finerty of Chicago,
Ill., and by other gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evening’s exercises likewise included solo and chorus singing,
with orchestral accompaniment, the selections including “The Star
Spangled Banner” and “Killarney.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h2 id='ADDRESS' class='c005'>ADDRESS TO THE SOCIETY BY PRESIDENT-GENERAL McGOWAN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The following address was issued early in the year by President-General
McGowan:</p>

<p class='c012'><em>To the Members of the American-Irish Historical Society</em>:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>: Permit me to express my gratitude for the honor
you have done me in electing me to be your president-general for the
ensuing year. I accept the office, and will discharge its duties and
responsibilities to the utmost of my ability.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be the official head of a society such as ours is a position any
man, no matter how exalted his place in life, should be proud to
hold. My distinguished predecessors in the office—Meade, Moseley,
Gargan, Crimmins, McAdoo—have ably presided over the Society’s
affairs in the past and have reflected honor upon the organization, as
honor has been reflected upon them in virtue of their being chosen
to that high station.</p>

<p class='c013'>The American-Irish Historical Society is now in its tenth year of
existence. It has accomplished a vast amount of good, and the
practical work it has so abundantly performed is of permanent value
and utility. No organization was more needed and none has a
broader or more glorious field in which to work.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Irish chapter in American history is one of the most important
and interesting in our career as a nation. It was a strong and important
chapter in America for even a century before we became a
nation, and has gone on increasing in importance and potency, in
value and interest, as generation has succeeded generation, until
today it stands unsurpassed in the respects mentioned.</p>

<p class='c013'>As John Boyle O’Reilly once wrote,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>We slight no true devotion, steal no fame</div>
      <div class='line'>From other shrines to gild the Pilgrims’ name.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>So I may say, we rob no race to gild the Irish name when we undertake
to unearth the records of the past, showing what the Irish element
has accomplished in the early colonial periods and in later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>periods when the republic was forming and had become a fact. We
merely wish to claim, assert and set forth the credit which to us
belongs, for the part that men and women of Irish blood took in
bringing about the reign of liberty and freedom we now enjoy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Toward people of all other race elements in the make-up of
the American people—English, French, Dutch, German, etc., by
whatever name they may be known or from whatever land they or
their ancestors may have come—we entertain good will and desire
them to have such meed of credit and of praise as to them belongs.
We do not wish to praise ourselves by “masquerading in borrowed
plumes,” nor have we any desire to detract one iota from the credit
that is honestly that of others.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the credit that is ours we demand and shall insist upon possessing.
Our mission is “To make better known the Irish chapter in
American history.” That brief statement of our principles conveys
in a very few words our exact reason for existence as a society.</p>

<p class='c013'>We are an American historical organization devoted to a work that
shall place the Irish element in this great republic in its proper and
merited position before the American people of which we constitute
no small part, and which shall, at the same time, reflect glory upon
the Irish fatherland. Our Society rests upon a generous basis. Its
founders builded wisely and for the perpetuation of the heroic deeds
of the past. I trust these founders will long be honored by every
member of the organization.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reviewing the work thus far accomplished by the Society, I am
prompted to say a few words: With very limited financial means,
we have, nevertheless, produced five handsome volumes of the <span class='sc'>Journal</span>
of the organization, two other volumes of great merit and a number
of extremely interesting pamphlets. Copies of these publications
have been placed in the leading libraries of the country, where they
have been cordially welcomed. Our publications are in the libraries
of such institutions as Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Dartmouth, Cornell,
Georgetown, Princeton, and other great universities, where they
are having an excellent influence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here in Washington our publications are in the library of Congress,
in that of the George Washington University, in the Catholic
University and in the newly-established Trinity College for young
women. The United States Military Academy at West Point also has
our works on its shelves, as has the Naval Academy at Annapolis.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>From many leading historical societies come reports of our publications
being received by them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many of the great public libraries—North, South, East and West
are in receipt of the works issued by our Society, and the same are in
constant demand for consultation and reference. Among these public
libraries are those of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston,
Chicago, Troy, Rochester, Oswego, Buffalo, Detroit, Milwaukee,
Minneapolis, Denver, San Francisco and other cities.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is practical work. I know of no other society that in so
short a time has done so much of real, lasting value as has ours.
Indeed, when we consider all the circumstances, we have done astonishingly
well. Many societies hoary with age, in the possession of
plethoric treasuries, and constantly receiving large bequests, have
done no better, if as well, from a practical viewpoint.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our Society is fortunate in having an indefatigable secretary, who
from the start has worked in season and out of season to advance the
interests of the organization. A competent secretary is a priceless
possession for any society, and we have been especially fortunate in
this respect.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Hon. John D. Crimmins of New York City, my immediate
predecessor in the office of president-general, has always been ready
with purse, services and hospitality to forward the interests of the Society,
and under his administration the organization has made splendid
progress. Owing to his initiative, a movement has just been started
to raise a permanent fund of $10,000 for the organization. This is
good news, indeed, and I have no doubt the amount will be speedily
raised. With a substantial fund such as this back of it, the Society
will be enabled to be of even greater service in the future than it
has in the past.</p>

<p class='c013'>The salient work of the organization must be its publications.
The more we have of these the better for the cause we have at heart.
While a dinner, now and then, is desirable, the organization must
never deteriorate into a mere dining club. Too many societies,
started with the most comprehensive program, have done this and
lost sight of their original purposes. Our Society differs from others
in that it is established for historical purposes, to make original
research into the records and documents of the past and to place the
result of its researches in permanent, tangible form. Careful and
frequent publications will enable us to do this.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>A great deal depends upon the continued issuance of the annual
volume of the <span class='sc'>Journal</span> of our Society. That work has thus far
been, and will continue to be, of the greatest possible utility. It
gives the Society a recognized standing in the community that would
be difficult to obtain by any other means. Its advent, year by year,
therefore, is of prime importance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Speaking incidentally, I may say that I would like to see special
attention given during the year to a study of the material bearing
upon the reputed voyages to these shores of the Irish missionary,
Brendan. These voyages, attributed to a period many centuries preceding
Christopher Columbus, appear to be fully as well authenticated
as those of the Northmen to Vinland. Indeed, the Norse
sagas mention remote Irish comers to these shores and duly credit
a land here once known as Great Ireland. De Roo, in his recent
work, the <cite>History of America Before Columbus</cite>, goes into this subject
in a very entertaining manner. As a rule, our school text-books on
history, while accepting implicitly the narratives relative to the
Northmen and Vinland, find no room in their pages to even allude
to Brendan and his voyages, although, as I have intimated, the latter
seem to rest upon as secure an historical basis as the former. Mr.
Justin Winsor and other distinguished writers, however, make special
mention of the subject and treat the latter with respect.</p>

<p class='c013'>The history of the early Irish in Virginia is also deserving of our
special attention. Irish names are found in the Old Dominion prior
to the arrival of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock, while in the Plymouth
colony itself, Governor Bradford tells us, numbers of Irish
arrived a few years after the coming of the <em>Mayflower</em>. The war
against the Indian king, Philip, 1675–’76, found Irish enlisted on
the side of the colonists, showing that at that period sons of old
Hibernia were numerous and active here. These and other early
periods and movements furnish our Society ample material for consideration.</p>

<p class='c013'>As American history progresses, the material increases in volume
and is greatly multiplied as the Revolution eventuates. But these
facts are well known to you and require no lengthy narrative of
detail on my part. I merely briefly refer to them in order, by way of
review, to indicate the abundance of material awaiting development
at our hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>I am delighted with the project now under way by the Society to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>erect a bronze tablet in the Rhode Island state capitol to the memory
of Maj.-Gen. John Sullivan. The idea is a most felicitous one and
deserves the heartiest commendation. Sullivan was one of the
great soldiers of the Revolution. The placing of the forthcoming
tablet will be a merited tribute to his patriotism and military skill
while in command of the Rhode Island department and during the
entire period of the war.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are many other great Americans of Irish blood who deserve
like honors, and doubtless the Society will, from time to time, erect
tablets to their memory or commemorate them in some other worthy
manner. The suggestion that the occasion of the dedication of the
Sullivan tablet be made a field day by the Society is a happy one, and
will, I trust, be fully carried out.</p>

<p class='c013'>As our Society grows in numbers and prosperity, the question of
permanent headquarters will demand consideration. Books and
pamphlets will accumulate by gift or purchase and a place will be
needed where these can be displayed for consultation by the members
and others engaged in historical research. Where these headquarters
shall be located is a subject for future action. A number of
cities are deserving of consideration. In many respects, Washington,
the national capital, would be the ideal place, while, New York,
Boston, Philadelphia and other cities, also present special advantages.
But this whole matter can be fully considered at some future
time.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Society recalls with pleasure its visit to Washington a few
years ago, when it was cordially received at the White House by our
distinguished fellow-member, President Roosevelt. I hope that during
my term as head of the organization the Society will again have
occasion to visit the national capital and once more partake of Washington
hospitality.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again expressing my gratitude for the honor you have conferred
upon me and hoping that I shall have, while president-general, the
generous assistance of every member of the Society, I remain</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>A brilliant event under the patronage of the Society took place in
New York City on April 26, 1906. The occasion was a reception
to Admiral John McGowan, U. S. N., the newly-elected president-general.
The exercises took place in the residence of the Hon.
John D. Crimmins, and will long be remembered by the large
assemblage participating. Admiral McGowan resides in Washington,
D. C., and the reception was held in order to give him and the
members of the Society an opportunity to exchange mutual greetings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reception was participated in by judges, prominent clergymen,
distinguished members of the medical, law, journalistic and
other professions, as well as by leading bankers and gentlemen
prominent in mercantile life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Admiral McGowan received in the magnificent drawing-room of
Mr. Crimmins’ home, the introductions being made by Mr. Crimmins,
who was assisted by Thomas Hamilton Murray of Boston,
the national secretary of the Society.</p>

<p class='c007'>The company inspected Mr. Crimmins’ splendid library and his
costly collections of rare old manuscripts and original letters.
Among the latter were notes written by Washington, Adams, Calhoun,
Jackson, Jefferson, Carroll, and other historic personages.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the Washington letters was one in which the father of his
country mentions his contemplated purchase of an Irish wolfdog, on
the recommendation of Lafayette. In a letter by Andrew Jackson
occurs this sentence: “For you know my parents were Irish.” This
very effectually disposes of those who have classed Jackson as
“Scotch-Irish.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Attention was called to Cyrus Townsend Brady’s new work, <cite>The
True Andrew Jackson</cite>, which is dedicated to Mr. Crimmins and
the American-Irish Historical Society, Doctor Brady being a member
of the latter. Much interest was also displayed in a new volume
by Mr. Crimmins himself, entitled <cite>Irish-American Historical Miscellany</cite>,
which has recently been brought out. It is a volume of
some five hundred pages and is replete with interesting data.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the exercises in the drawing-room, lunch was served, and
was followed by addresses, readings and musical selections. The
whole occasion was one of unusual interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>The horrors of the <em>Jersey</em> prison ship have often been told. The
<em>Jersey</em> and other hulks, used by the British, were anchored near the
Wallabout, Brooklyn, N. Y. Many thousands of prisoners perished
on these ships by cruelty and disease. The conduct of their captors
was inhumane and dastardly. It is not surprising, therefore, that
the mortality was so great.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Burke, a prisoner aboard the <em>Jersey</em>, at one time, has left
a record in which he states that he was confined on the ship fourteen
months, and that he saw, among other cruelties, many American
prisoners put to death by the bayonet. This cruel treatment was
never relaxed by the English or Scots, but sometimes the more
humane Hessians evinced pity for the unfortunate sufferers. Burke
says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“During that period, among other cruelties which were committed,
I have known many of the American prisoners put to death by the
bayonet: in particular, I well recollect, that it was the custom on
board the ship for but one prisoner at a time to be admitted on deck
at night, besides the guards or sentinels. One night, while the prisoners
were many of them assembled at the grate at the hatchway,
for the purpose of obtaining fresh air, and waiting their turn to go
on deck, one of the sentinels thrust his bayonet down among them,
and in the morning twenty-five of them were found wounded, and
stuck in the head, and dead of the wounds they had thus received. I
further recollect that this was the case several mornings, when sometimes
five, sometimes six, and sometimes eight or ten, were found
dead by the same means.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is estimated that over eleven thousand prisoners perished, from
all causes, aboard these ships during the Revolution. The dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>would be carried ashore and carelessly buried in the sand, their
bodies, in many cases, to be uncovered by returning tides. For many
years after, the bones of these martyrs were visible along the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>About 1801, John Jackson sold to the United States, through
Francis Childs, a middleman, forty acres of the Wallabout for
$40,000. About this time large numbers of Irish refugees arrived
and located in New York and Brooklyn. They bought some land
of Jackson at, or near, the Wallabout, the settlement being named
“Vinegar Hill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>During the summer of 1805, a Mr. Aycrigg, shocked at the
exposed remains of the prison-ship victims, made a contract with an
Irishman residing at Wallabout, to “collect all the human bones as
far as may be without digging,” and deliver the same to him. This
was done, and these bones were a portion of those interred in the
vault patriotically erected by Tammany.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the patriots imprisoned aboard the <em>Jersey</em> were a great
many Irish. In 1888, the Society of Old Brooklynites published a
pamphlet dealing with the <em>Jersey</em>, and giving the names of several
thousand persons who had been confined therein, many of whom
perished. A copy of this pamphlet is in the possession of the New
York Historical Society. From that authoritative source we have
compiled the following list of patriots, bearing Irish names, who
were confined on the <em>Jersey</em>:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Many other Irish names could be added, but sufficient have been
given to establish the fact that a large number of the sons of Erin
were among those who suffered the rigors of the <em>Jersey</em> prison ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. Thomas Dring, who was a prisoner aboard the <em>Jersey</em>, tells
us in his <cite>Recollections</cite> many startling facts about that terrible
ship. He says: “Silence was a stranger to our dark abode. There
were continual noises during the night. The groans of the sick and
dying; the curses poured out by the weary and exhausted upon our
inhuman keepers; the restlessness caused by the suffocating heat and
the confined and poisonous air, mingled with the wild and incoherent
ravings of delirium, were the sounds which, every night, were raised
around us in all directions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And another writer states that the lower hold, and the orlop deck,
were such a terror that no man would venture down into them.
Dysentery, smallpox and yellow fever broke out, and “while so many
were sick with raging fever, there was a loud cry for water; but
none could be had except on the upper deck, and but one was allowed
to ascend at a time. The suffering then from the rage of thirst during
the night, was very great. Nor was it at all times safe to attempt
to go up. Provoked by the continual cry to be allowed to ascend,
when there was already one on deck, the sentry would push them
back with his bayonet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stiles in his <cite>History of the City of Brooklyn</cite>, narrates a scene that
took place on the <em>Jersey</em>, July 4, 1782. He says: “A very serious
conflict with the guard occurred&nbsp;... in consequence of the
prisoners attempting to celebrate the day with such observances and
amusements as their condition permitted. Upon going on deck in
the morning, they displayed thirteen little national flags in a row
upon the booms, which were immediately torn down and trampled
under the feet of the guard, which on that day happened to consist
of Scotchmen. Deigning no notice of this, the prisoners proceeded
to amuse themselves with patriotic songs, speeches and cheers, all
the while avoiding whatever could be construed into an intentional
insult of the guard; which, however, at an unusually early hour in
the afternoon, drove them below at the point of the bayonet, and
closed the hatches. Between decks, the prisoners now continued
their singing, etc., until about nine o’clock in the evening. An order
to desist not having been promptly complied with, the hatches were
suddenly removed and the guards descended among them, with lanterns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>and cutlasses in their hands. Then ensued a scene of terror.
The helpless prisoners, retreating from the hatchways as far as their
crowded condition would permit, were followed by the guards, who
mercilessly hacked, cut, and wounded everyone within their reach;
and then ascending again to the upper deck, fastened down the
hatches upon the poor victims of their cruel rage, leaving them to
languish through the long, sultry summer night, without water to
cool their parched throats, and without lights by which they might
have dressed their wounds. And to add to their torment, it was not
until the middle of the next forenoon that the prisoners were allowed
to go on deck and slake their thirst, or to receive their rations of
food, which, that day, they were obliged to eat uncooked. <em>Ten
corpses</em> were found below on the morning which succeeded that memorable
fourth of July, and many others were badly wounded.”</p>

<p class='c007'>An especially affecting incident is told regarding one prisoner,
who died on the ship: “Two young men, brothers, belonging to a
rifle corps, were made prisoners and sent on board the <em>Jersey</em>. The
elder took the fever and, in a few days, became delirious. One night
(his end was fast approaching) he became calm and sensible, and
lamenting his hard fate and the absence of his mother, begged for a
little water. His brother, with tears, entreated the guard to give
him some, but in vain. The sick youth was soon in his last struggles,
when his brother offered the guard a guinea for an inch of candle,
only that he might see him die. Even this was denied. ‘Now,’
said he, drying up his tears, ‘if it please God that I ever regain my
liberty, I’ll be a most bitter enemy!’ He regained his liberty,
rejoined the army, and when the war ended he had <em>eight large and
one hundred and twenty-seven small</em> notches on his rifle stock.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Pennsylvania <cite>Packet</cite>, September 4, 1781, published a letter
from the <em>Jersey</em>, which said: “We bury six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
and eleven men in a day; we have two hundred more sick and falling
sick every day.” This will illustrate the terrible mortality aboard
the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his <cite>Recollections of Brooklyn and New York in 1776</cite>, Johnson
says of the prisoners dying on the <em>Jersey</em>: “It was no uncommon
thing to see five or six dead bodies brought on shore in a single
morning, when a small excavation would be dug at the foot of the
hill, the bodies be thrown in and a man with a shovel would cover
them by shovelling sand down the hill upon them. Many were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>buried in a ravine of the hill; some on the farm. The whole shore,
from Rennie’s Point to Mr. Remsen’s dooryard was a place of
graves; as were also the slope of the hill near the house&nbsp;...;
the shore from Mr. Ramsen’s barn along the mill pond, to Rapelje’s,
and the sandy island between the floodgates and the mill-dam, while
a few were buried on the shore on the east side of the Wallabout.
Thus did <em>Death</em> reign <em>here</em>, from 1776 until the peace. The whole
Wallabout was a sickly place during the war. The atmosphere
seemed to be charged with foul air from the prison ships, and with
the effluvia of the dead bodies washed out of their graves by the
tides. We believe that more than half of the dead buried on the
outer side of the mill-pond, were washed out by the waves at high
tide, during northeasterly winds. The bones of the dead lay exposed
along the beach, drying and bleaching in the sun, and whitening the
shore, till reached by the power of a succeeding storm; as the agitated
waters receded, the bones receded with them into the deep....
We have, ourselves, examined many of the skulls lying
on the shore. From the teeth, they appeared to be the remains of
men in the prime of life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The <em>Jersey</em> at length,” declares Stiles, “became so crowded, and
the increase of disease among the prisoners so rapid, that even the
hospital ships were inadequate for their reception. In this emergency,
bunks were erected on the larboard side of the upper deck of
the <em>Jersey</em> for the accommodation of the sick between decks. The
horrors of the old hulk were now increased a hundred-fold. Foul
air, confinement, darkness, hunger, thirst, the slow poison of the
malarious locality in which the ship was anchored, the torments of
vermin, the suffocating heat alternating with cold and, above all, the
<em>almost total absence of hope</em>, performed their deadly work
unchecked. ‘The whole ship, from her keel to the taffrail, was
equally affected, and contained pestilence sufficient to desolate a
world—disease and death were wrought into her very timbers.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was, indeed,” Stiles remarks, “one condition upon which
these hapless sufferers might have escaped the torture of this slow but
certain death, and that was enlistment into the British service. This
chance was daily offered them by the recruiting officers who visited
the ship, but their persuasions and offers were almost invariably
treated with contempt, and that, too, by men who fully expected to
die where they were. In spite of their untold physical sufferings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>which might well have shaken the resolution of the strongest; in
spite of the insinuations of the British that they were neglected by
their government—insinuations which seemed to be corroborated by
the very facts of their condition; in defiance of threats of even
harsher treatment, and regardless of promises of food and clothing—objects
most tempting to men in their condition; but few, comparatively,
sought relief from their woes by the betrayal of their honor.
And these few went forth into liberty followed by the execrations
and undisguised contempt of the suffering heroes whom they left
behind. It was this calm, unfaltering, unconquerable spirit of
patriotism—defying torture, starvation, loathsome disease, and the
prospect of a neglected and forgotten grave—which sanctifies to
every American heart the scene of their suffering in the Wallabout,
and which will render the sad story of the ‘prison ships’ one of ever-increasing
interest to all future generations.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The corner-stone of a vault for the reception of so many of the
bones of the martyred dead as could be collected, was laid in April,
1808, by Tammany. The event was made the occasion of a great
demonstration. There was a big military and civic parade, artillery
salutes and other features. Major Aycrigg was marshal of the day
and an eloquent oration was delivered by Joseph D. Fay of Tammany.
On May 26, 1808, the vault being completed, the bones were
removed thereto, the event being signalized by another great demonstration.
There were thirteen coffins filled with bones of the dead,
and 104 veterans of the Revolution acted as pall-bearers. Stiles
informs us that “The procession, after passing through various
streets, reached the East River, where, at different places, boats had
been provided for crossing to Brooklyn. Thirteen large open boats
transported the thirteen tribes of the Tammany Society, each containing
one tribe, one coffin, and the pall-bearers.” The scene was most
inspiring. “At Brooklyn ferry the procession formed again&nbsp;...
and arrived at the tomb of the martyrs amidst a vast and
mighty assemblage. A stage had been here erected for the orator,
trimmed with black crape. The coffins were placed in front, and
the pall-bearers took their seats beneath the eye of the orator. There
was an invocation by Rev. Ralph Williston, and the orator of the
day was Dr. Benjamin DeWitt. The coffins were huge in size and
each bore the name of one of the thirteen original states.”</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>COMMERCE BETWEEN IRELAND AND RHODE ISLAND.</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='small'>BY THOMAS HAMILTON MURRAY, BOSTON, MASS.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Including Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island has a long extent of
coast line. There are in the state 90,000 acres of safe anchorage,
varying in depth from six feet to twenty fathoms. The state has
the Atlantic Ocean as its southern boundary. Of its cities and towns
some twenty border on deep, salt water. It is not surprising, therefore,
that Rhode Island early attained maritime importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>For many years ships were sent all over the world from Providence,
Warren, Bristol and Newport. Their sails whitened many
seas. These Rhode Island mariners were a hardy race and worthy
of the great merchants for whom they sailed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the year 1700, their vessels had already become numerous.
In due time they were known in Barbadoes, Jamaica, St. Kitt’s,
Nevis, Montserrat and Bermuda. Their sailors cheerily sang in the
ports of Madeira, Fayal, Surinam and Curaçao, and were welcomed
even in India and China.</p>

<p class='c007'>The slave trade was the object of some of these voyages, commerce
of others, while the fisheries engaged the attention of the rest. In
1738, Newport alone had over one hundred vessels engaged in business
throughout the world. In 1763, the same place sent out 182
vessels on foreign voyages in addition to the 352 coastwise and fishing
vessels. These were manned, all told, by 2,200 seamen. In
June and July, 1774, the vessels arriving at Newport from foreign
voyages numbered 64, in addition to 132 coastwise and 17 whalers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Providence was also a great port. An address to Congress, in
1790, stated that there “is a greater number of vessels belonging to
this port (Providence) than to New York,” and that “it is a place
of more navigation than any of its size in the Union.” Fortunes
were rapidly made by merchants engaged in the foreign trade, while
domestic commerce also brought in its wealth. In reaching out to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>trade with the world Rhode Island merchants, unlike some “historians”
of today, did not forget Ireland.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several Rhode Island vessels made regular voyages to and from
Irish ports. Others made occasional ones, or touched at Belfast,
Newry, Dublin, Londonderry, Cork or Waterford, on their way to or
from British and other ports. A list of fifteen vessels engaged regularly
or occasionally in the Irish trade, is here given: Ships, <em>Hope</em>,
<em>Mary</em>, <em>Neptune</em>, <em>Tristram</em>, <em>Nancy</em>, <em>Robert Burns</em>, <em>Catherine</em> and
<em>Faithful Stewart</em>; brigs, <em>Little John</em>, <em>Betsy</em>, <em>Recovery</em>, <em>Sally</em>, <em>Lydia</em>
and <em>Happy Return</em>; schooner, <em>Mayflower</em>. There were probably
many others, but these fifteen are sufficient to illustrate the point.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the captains were Rathbun, Davis, Ambrose, Taggart,
Dring, Warner, Crawford, Staples, Coffin, Noyes, Allen, Smith,
Cook, McCansland, Coggeshall and Howland.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the foregoing vessels, the <em>Mary</em> and <em>Little John</em> belonged to
George Gibbs of Newport; the <em>Hope</em> to Samuel Fowler of Newport;
the <em>Betsy</em> to Charles Handy and the <em>Recovery</em> to Chris. Ellery, both
also of Newport. These five vessels are specifically mentioned in
the <cite>Newport Historical Magazine</cite> as making regular voyages to Ireland.
From time to time the Newport <cite>Mercury</cite> chronicles the
arrival from Ireland, or departure therefor, of other ships and brigs.
These were all in addition to those sailing between Ireland and
Providence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the articles imported from Ireland to Rhode Island at
various times, were linen and woolen goods, Irish poplins, cambrics,
lawns, silks, hosiery, sheetings, etc. Irish butter, beef and other food
products, were also imported. The Newport <cite>Mercury</cite>, August 3,
1772, contains an advertisement in which, among other things, “Irish
beef” is announced for sale. In the Providence <cite>Gazette</cite>, November
20, 1762, appears the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the Newport packet from New York, we are informed, for
certain, that there are 2000 Firkins of the Best Irish Rose butter,
arrived there.—A quantity of it is expected to be imported into this
town, which we are confident will fall the price of that commodity.”
Under date of December 25, 1762, the <cite>Gazette</cite> says: “Since our last,
we hear that a vessel has arrived at Newport from Ireland, with 1300
Firkins of butter—Captain Champlain, the master of her, died soon
after he came out.” In December, 1764, a vessel from Ireland mistook
her bearings and went ashore on Block Island. The following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>notice of the disaster was published in the <cite>Gazette</cite>, January 12,
1765:</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the 25th of last month, in the day time, a large double-decked
brig, loaded with beef, pork, butter, and candles, bound from Ireland
to Halifax run ashore on the north part of Block Island, where she
soon beat to pieces; the people were all saved except the boatswain,
who perished on the deck, which he would not be permitted to quit
with the rest.—About 500 barrels of the cargo, with some other articles,
were also saved. The master’s name we cannot learn.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The name of the wrecked brig is believed to have been the <em>Golden
Grove</em>. Her Irish cargo was in the nature of supplies for the British
garrison at Halifax. The fact that the cargo consisted of beef, pork,
butter and candles, indicate that those articles were exported from
Ireland in considerable quantities at that period.</p>

<p class='c007'>Speaking of this wreck, recalls the fact that in 1763, the year
before, a Rhode Island vessel was stranded on the Irish coast. She
was the <em>Samuel and Joseph</em>, Captain Brown, bound for Amsterdam.
In November and December, 1766, the Providence <cite>Gazette</cite> contained
this advertisement:</p>

apply to said Captain on board or to Mr. Benjamin Greene, in Newport.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Providence</span>, Nov. 7, 1766.</p>

<p class='c007'>June 15, 1772, the Newport <cite>Mercury</cite> notes the arrival at Newport
of “the brig <em>Joseph</em>, Captain Pie, bound to New York in 49 days
from Waterford in Ireland.” July 19, 1773, the same paper states
that “Last Thursday arrived the brig <em>Sally</em>, Capt. John Murphy, in
30 days from Jamaica.” She brought several passengers. This was
probably the <em>Sally</em> that at another time is mentioned as having
reached Dublin under Captain Davis. The Providence <cite>Gazette</cite>,
February 24, 1776, has this interesting note: “Arrived from Ireland,
but last from Barbadoes, the sloop <em>N. York</em> packet, Capt. John
Freers, who informs that the people in Ireland and Barbadoes are
very warm in the cause of America.” The <cite>Gazette</cite> also published
the following:</p>

and Nightingale, in Providence, or the Captain on board.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Providence</span>, Jan. 29, 1785.</p>

<p class='c007'>Special attention is called to the fact that “passage” is advertised
in connection with these voyages. This is good evidence that passengers
sailed direct for Rhode Island from Ireland. Some of these
were probably merchants or their agents engaged in the Irish trade.
The fact that such accommodations were provided, likewise justifies
the conclusion that immigrants also came direct from Ireland to
Rhode Island, and in considerable numbers, too. These immigrants,
in all probability, landed, some in Newport and others in Providence.
It may be, too, that Warren, Bristol, Westerly and other places, likewise
received direct Irish accessions from this source. Further on
will be found additional evidence of direct immigration from Ireland.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another advertisement in the Providence <cite>Gazette</cite> reads as follows:</p>

<h4 class='c011'>FOR DUBLIN</h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

Russell. She has good accommodations for Passengers.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Providence</span>, Jan. 14, 1786.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here again “passage” is advertised, it will be noted. Soon after
a news item appeared in the <cite>Gazette</cite>, stating that “the ship <em>Tristram</em>,
Captain Crawford, sails this day for Dublin.” It appears that the
<em>Tristram</em> made many voyages to and from Ireland. On April 26,
1788, over two years after the trip just mentioned, the <cite>Gazette</cite> had
the following budget of marine news:</p>

<p class='c013'>The ship Tristram, Capt. Warner, of this port, is arrived at Dublin.—The
ship Mary, Capt. Rathbun, and Brig Little John, Capt. Ambrose, of Newport,
are also arrived at Dublin.—The Brig Recovery, Capt. Taggart, of Newport,
is arrived at Newry.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>In June, 1791, Joseph and William Russell of Providence had
an assortment of Irish linens “Just imported in the ship <em>Tristram</em>
from Dublin.” The <cite>Gazette</cite>, under date of Providence, April 13,
1776, says: “Capt. Cook, from Belfast, informs that recruiting parties
had been beating up there from September till January to reinforce
the ministerial army in America, but they had only inlisted ten
men.” This helps the reader to form a good idea as to the direction
of Irish sympathies at that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quotations in the remainder of this chapter are from the
Providence <cite>Gazette</cite>. A news paragraph, dated Newport, states that
on “Monday last arrived here the ship <em>Mary</em>, Captain Ambrose, in
fifty-nine days from Cork.” On February 14, 1789, under the head
of Providence, we are told that “On Wednesday also arrived the
brig <em>Happy Return</em>, Capt. Dring, from Dublin, Isle of May, and St.
Eustatia.” The <em>Happy Return</em> has frequent mention, sometimes as
arriving from Dublin and again from other ports. But there came
a time when she returned no more. The incident occurred in 1790,
and is thus narrated: “The brig <em>Happy Return</em>, Capt. Dring, of
this port (Providence), bound for Dublin, is lost near that port.
The crew and a part of the cargo were saved.” In April, 1790, is
chronicled the arrival at Dublin of the brig <em>Sally</em>, Captain Davis, of
Providence, “after a short passage of twenty two days.” In November
of the same year, the ship <em>Tristram</em>, Captain Warner, is again
mentioned as having cleared for Dublin from Providence. Among
the arrivals in the port of Providence in May, 1791, was the “ship
<em>Tristram</em>, Warner, Dublin.” In November, 1791, the <em>Tristram</em>,
commanded by Captain Holowell, departed from Providence for
Newry. December 14, 1792, the brig <em>Betsy</em> left Providence for
Newry and in May of the next year, her arrival at Providence is
noted “from Newry, which she left the 5th of March, having touched
at the Cape de Verds.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In April, 1796, the brig <em>Lydia</em>, Capt. John Cook, arrived at
Providence from Cork in forty-nine days. We find it recorded
December 21, 1799, that “A ship from Cork put into Newport on
Sunday evening last, and sailed next morning. She brought Cork
papers to the 24th of October.” Elsewhere it is stated that earlier
in that year the ship <em>Palmyra</em>, Captain Trotter, of Providence, for
Hamburg, put into “the Cove of Cork.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The schooner <em>Mayflower</em> left Providence for Dublin in February,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>1801. In 1809, among the departures from the port of Providence
was the “Ship <em>Neptune</em>, Staples, Ireland.” The same year it is
stated that the “ship <em>Nancy</em>, of Rhode Island, 14 days from Richmond
for Cork, was spoke July 6, lat. 43:52.” In October, 1809, the
brig <em>Orient</em> arrived at New York “53 days from Dublin. Left there
among others, ship <em>Nancy</em>, Capt. Noyes, just arrived from Providence.”
These Rhode Island captains became great favorites in Irish
ports. They were frequently entertained and were treated in a hospitable
manner generally. In 1811, Capt. Peregrine Howland of
Newport, died in Belfast. He was in his thirty-ninth year at the
time, and his passing away caused much sorrow. The ship <em>Robert
Burns</em>, Captain Coffin, arrived at Newport January 3, 1820, “in 39
days from Ireland.” The ship <em>George Washington</em>, of Providence, is
noted as having arrived at Cork March 26, 1820, “from Madeira in
15 days.” She was commanded by Captain Allen. Under a Newport
date of January 6, 1820, we find the following: “Arrived on
Tuesday last, in distress, ship <em>William and Jane</em>, Brown, from N.
York, with flaxseed, bound to Londonderry,—Sailed from N. York,
Dec. 24, and next day the ship sprung a leak, which continued to
increase, and was compelled to throw over part of the cargo, and put
into this port.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It will thus be seen that flaxseed was exported to Ireland from this
country. That is perhaps what Black &amp; Stewart, Irish merchants of
Providence, intended to do with the “2000 bushels of good and well
clean’d flax seed” they advertised for in 1763.</p>

<p class='c007'>From facts here adduced it will be seen that for a great many
years, until Irish manufacturing industries were crushed by English
law, commercial relations existed between Ireland and Rhode Island.
Irish goods and Irish passengers were landed on the wharves in Newport
and Providence, while outgoing ships took goods and passengers
for the old land. Too long have these facts been forgotten or
ignored. But a new era has dawned and the sun of investigation will
yet bring forth even greater and more interesting developments.</p>

<p class='c006'>John Burns, a native of the city of Dublin, where he was born in
1730, was a prominent character in Pennsylvania history. He emigrated
to Philadelphia when quite young. He prospered in business
in that city, where we are told “he took a prominent part in all local
and national questions, and was honored by his fellow-citizens with
many positions of trust.” He was the first governor of Pennsylvania
elected after the adoption of the federal constitution, and
“retained in a high degree the respect and confidence of his fellow-citizens
till his death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the very earliest white settlers in Greene County was
Thomas Hughes, who emigrated from Donegal with his wife, Bridget
O’Neill, to Virginia. One of his descendants, Thomas Hughes,
wrote the memoirs of his family in 1880, in which he said: “The
motive that sent our first ancestor to this country from his native
Irish home was of this character, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, a desire for religious freedom;
he was a devout Catholic.” “Settling,” he continues, “in the valley
of Virginia, in Loudoun County, before the year 1739, Thomas
Hughes, son of Felime or Felix, and his wife, with his brother
Felime or Felix, all from Inver, in Donegal, Ulster, first laid the
foundations of his family in this country.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thomas Hughes was a noted hunter, and in one of his expeditions
into the backwoods, which lasted for several months, he spent
some time in what is now Greene County, Pennsylvania, the soil and
general appearance of which pleased him so well that he determined
to make his future home there. This he did in 1771, and was one
of the very first white settlers in that country. He located where
Carmichaelstown now stands, but several years afterwards exchanged
farms with a party named Carmichael, and called his new place
Jefferson, after his old county in Virginia.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>His nephew, Felix Hughes, also settled in Pennsylvania, where he
erected a fort or blockhouse as protection against the Indians and
wild animals. It was a building of only one story and a half, of
hewn logs and rough boards, and as an instance of the primitiveness
of the period when this Irish pioneer settled in this locality, this
building was looked upon as “an elegant house!” His wife’s name
was Cinthia Kaighn (or Kane). In 1780, he set out with others to
Kentucky to look up lands, but the party was attacked by Indians
while descending the Ohio and, after a narrow escape, Hughes
returned to Greene County, where he spent the remainder of his
days. He and his father were buried in Neill’s burying ground,
near Carmichaelstown. Their descendants are still found in considerable
numbers in Greene and Fayette counties, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c007'>A prominent Irish Catholic who settled early on Sherman’s Creek,
was Henry Gass. He and his brother erected log cabins on Indian
lands in Perry County, but were dispossessed from there in 1750,
when they located at Falling Springs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Patrick Gass, who was born in the latter place in 1771, and who is
said to have been the first white man to make an overland trip to the
Pacific, is presumed to have been a son of Henry Gass. The original
name, of course, was Prendergast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the earlier Irish inhabitants of Carlisle is found the Prendergrass
family, whose name is identified with almost all the larger
settlements west of Carlisle. Kline’s <cite>Carlisle Gazette</cite> of November
29, 1797, gave an account of the death of the aged Philip Prendergrass,
which occurred two weeks previously, in which it described
him as “an old inhabitant of this borough.” The name is found on
the “list of taxables” in 1762. He took part in the expedition of
Kitanning, in 1756, to repulse the Indians. It was a member of this
family, Garrett Prendergrass who, in February, 1770, purchased the
ground now occupied by the city of Allegheny, from the Six Nations.
The old Prendergrass homestead was near Hanover, and is still occupied
by the family. It was built in the last century by an Irishman
names Byrnes, who married into the family.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wing’s <cite>History of Cumberland County</cite> mentions John and Charles
McManus, as settlers in Carlisle in 1762, the latter as “one of the
oldest, most progressive and successful business men in the community.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The large and commodious dwelling he erected on East Street,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>says Ganss, one of the historians of Carlisle, “still remains as a monument
of post-colonial massiveness, spaciousness and solidity, with
its marble slab conspicuously placed in the second story, bearing the
date of its erection, 1797, and the name of its builder, and which
gives evidence not only of enterprise and wealth, but cultured taste.
Originally, he was proprietor of one of the largest distilleries in the
county, and amassed a sufficient competence which permitted him to
live, if not in luxury, at least in ease and comfort. After the death
of Mrs. Mary McManus (born 1703, died 1809), the name becomes
less prominent, although that of Charles is still found on the pew
list of the Catholic Church as late as 1823. The descendants
drifted to Mexico and Philadelphia. The former branch of the
family, in the course of time, founded the prosperous and famed
banking firm of McManus &amp; Co., an institution of international reputation
and the largest and most prominent in our sister republic.
The Philadelphia family likewise, achieved more than ordinary success
in life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here we have a conspicuous example of the class of men whom
Ireland gave to America in her early days.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Frazer, who was born at Glassborough, County Monaghan,
in 1709, left Ireland in 1735 and located in Philadelphia. In course
of time he became a very wealthy man. He was a shipping merchant,
owning several vessels engaged in the West Indian trade. He
married Mary Smith, who was born in Cleary, County Monaghan.
He died in Philadelphia in 1765. His son, Patrick Frazer, commanded
a company of the Fourth Pennsylvania, a regiment under the
command of Anthony Wayne. He became lieutenant-colonel of the
Fifth Pennsylvania, and was brigadier-general of Pennsylvania militia.
His grandson, Robert Frazer, was a distinguished lawyer at
Thornbury, Pa.</p>

<p class='c007'>John McCord emigrated from Ireland in 1750, and settled in Sherman’s
Valley, Pa. His father also located at Landisburg, Pa., about
the same time, and on his farm a fort was erected for protection
against the Redmen in the Indian war of 1755. It is still known as
McCord’s Fort.</p>

<p class='c007'>David Milligan came from Ireland to Mifflin County, Pennsylvania,
in 1766. He and his two brothers, John and James, served in
the Fifth Battalion of Cumberland Militia through the Revolutionary
War. David was twice taken prisoner. All these were in active
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>service up to 1778. Their brother, Thomas, and their mother,
joined them from Ireland in 1785.</p>

<p class='c007'>Robert Guthrie, a name Anglicized from McGrath, was born in
Derry; settled with his family in Lancaster County in 1744. His
wife’s name was Brighid Dougherty, a native of Carndonagh, County
Donegal. Their son was a lieutenant-colonel in Colonel Brodhead’s
regiment through the Revolutionary War. He was in the expedition
against the Six Nations, and with Harbison’s company of rangers
in the border wars against the Indians. His great-grandson was
mayor of Pittsburg in 1897.</p>

<p class='c007'>Roger Connor, a native of Cork, settled at Lancaster in 1740. He
established a hat factory there and purchased lands in many parts of
the province, principally in Lancaster, Carlisle and York. He had
Irishmen in his employ, too, and in the Philadelphia <cite>Mercury</cite> of
November 24, 1743, he advertised for “Patrick Dollard, a hatter by
trade, aged about twenty years, a lusty, well-set fellow, etc.” Patrick
was a redemptioner and had left the service of his countryman
before his term had expired. It was Roger Connor who gave the
land on which St. Mary’s Church, in Lancaster, was built. His
name appears on the list of subscribers to the fund for the relief of
the sufferers by the Boston massacre in the Revolution. He died at
Lancaster in 1776.</p>

<p class='c007'>John and Charles Connor also settled in Lancaster about 1740,
and are thought to have been kinsmen of Roger. In 1758, Charles
went to Philadelphia and his name appears on the list of the early
contributors to St. Mary’s Church. He died in 1775 and bequeathed
his property to his nephew, Charles, son of Cornelius O’Connor, of
Carrigtwohill, County Cork.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another family named Connor lived in Ashton Township, Chester
County. Charles Connor died there in 1750.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thomas G. Connor, son of another Charles Connor, who was born
at Philadelphia in 1786, is buried in Mount Vernon Cemetery, Philadelphia.
His wife’s name was Martha Fitzgerald.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morgan Connor, or O’Connor, was one of the early settlers in
Pennsylvania. In the <cite>Pennsylvania Archives</cite>, Vol. X, he is referred
to as “among the first to enter the service of his country as lieutenant
in Captain George Nagle’s company, in Colonel Thompson’s regiment.”
After the campaign of 1775–’76 he was ordered south as a
brigade major for Gen. John Armstrong. He served with credit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>down to the winter of 1779, and on his return in that year he became
lieutenant-colonel of Hartley’s regiment and subsequently colonel of
the Eleventh Regiment. He was lost at sea in 1780, on a voyage to
the West Indies. According to Volume I, No. 47, Register of Wills
Office, Philadelphia, letters of administration on O’Connor’s estate
were granted to Dennis McCarthy, on September 8, 1780, when McCarthy,
Bryan O’Hara and Patrick Byrne gave a bond in the sum
of £3,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a pamphlet issued by Benjamin Franklin in 1744, entitled,
<cite>Plain Talk, or Serious Considerations on the Present State of the
City of Philadelphia and Province of Pennsylvania</cite>, appears a letter
written in that year by Governor Morris of New Jersey, to Governor
Clinton of New York, in which he said: “There are here a
Popish chapel and numbers of Irish and Germans that are Papists,
and I am told that should the French land 1,500 or 2,000 men, they
would in that province soon get ten or twelve thousands together,
which would in that case be not a little dangerous to these and neighboring
colonies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Edward McGuire, who belonged to the staff of General McGuire
in Austria, came to Philadelphia in 1751, with wines, in which he
had invested his patrimony. He was the son of Constantine McGuire
and Julia MacEllengot of the County of Kerry. He established
himself in business in Philadelphia, but subsequently went to Alexandria,
Va., thence to Winchester in 1753, where he built a hotel and
gave the ground for and built the Catholic Church at Winchester in
1790. He died in 1806. His descendants were lawyers, doctors
and ministers, some of whom married into the best old Virginia
families.</p>

<p class='c007'>Acrelius, in his <cite>History of New Sweden</cite> (as Pennsylvania was
sometimes called prior to the English settlement), writing of 1758,
said: “Forty years back our people scarcely knew what a school
was. In the later times there have come over from Ireland some
Presbyterians and some Roman Catholics, who commenced with
school keeping, but as soon as they saw better openings they gave
that up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the early Philadelphia schoolmasters, the following advertised
in the <cite>Mercury</cite>: Charles Phipps, “from Dublin,” in 1729, and
James Conway, on July 17, 1729. George Brownwell also advertised
his school in the same year. The schoolroom later became a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>dancing academy, and was opened by “Theobald Hacket, dancing
master, lately come from England and Ireland.” Alexander Butler
advertised his school on November 12, 1741. On June 21, 1790,
John Reilly opened a school at Columbia, and in the following year
his scholars were taken by Francis Dunlevy, who taught the higher
branches. This was continued until 1793, when Reilly gave the
entire school to Dunlevy and opened another school at Mill Creek.
It is stated in the <cite>Magazine of Western History</cite> for February,
1888, that this was the first school in the American settlements of the
Ohio.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of these Irish schoolmasters are mentioned in Wickersham’s
<cite>History of Education in Pennsylvania</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>An Irish schoolmaster taught school at Chester in 1741. Rev. Mr.
Backhouse of that borough, wrote the London Society for Propagation
of the Gospel, that the Quakers had “set up another schoolmaster,
one of their own sort truly, but a native Irish bigoted Papist, in
opposition to one Charles Fortesque.” The name of this Irish
schoolmaster is not mentioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Conly taught “an advanced school” at Byberry, Philadelphia
County, before the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Downey, who was among the first settlers of Harrisburg,
according to Wickersham, taught school at Harrisburg for a number
of years. He was also a justice of the peace, town clerk and member
of the Assembly. In 1796, he presented Governor Mifflin a
plan for a state system of education, “in which he discussed the whole
subject of education, showing a wonderful sense of its importance in
a government like ours and a clear conception of the nature of the
system necessary to make it general.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On May 15, 1767, Miss Mary McAllister advertised in the Philadelphia
papers to open a boarding school for young ladies in that
city. “Hers was the first school of the kind in Philadelphia” (Wickersham).</p>

<p class='c007'>Thomas Neill was a schoolmaster in the Wyoming Valley before
the massacre of 1778. He is described as “an Irishman of middle
age, learned, a Catholic, a Free Mason, fond of dress, remarkable for
his fine flow of spirits and pleasing manners, a bachelor and a schoolmaster.”
He lost his life in the massacre of Wyoming.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1790, a number of Catholics from Maryland settled in Cambria
County, Pennsylvania. “A school was opened there,” says Wickersham,
“under the direction of a schoolmaster named O’Connor.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Wickersham also states that the pioneer settler of northern Cambria
County was a Captain Maguire. Other settlers who followed
him from Maryland in 1790 were named Kaylor, Burns, McDale
and Carroll, the descendants of the latter having been the founders
of the present town of Carrolltown. The second white child born
in that section is said to have been Michael Maguire. The number
of places in Cambria County which bear Irish names indicate the
extent of these Irish settlements. For instance, Driscoll, Carrolltown,
Kaylor, Dale, Dougherty, Sheridan, Condon and Patton,
called after the settlers, and Dysart and Munster, called after Irish
places. Immediately to the north of Cambria, in Clearfield County,
there are places names Mahaffey, McGee, McCartney, McCauley,
Welshdale, Moran, Curryrun, Mitchel, Shawville, Barrett and Donegal,
and in the other counties surrounding Cambria, are places called
Tyrone, Armagh, Avonmore, McKee, Curryville, Kelley, Fleming,
Connor, Daley, Downey, Lavansville, and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>James Nowlins taught school at Mauch Chunk. According to
Wickersham, he was one of the first white men who located at that
place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Paddy” Doyle taught school at Phœnixville. He is mentioned
in Pennypacker’s <cite>Annals of Phœnixville</cite>. A description of him says
“his nationality was revealed by a very decided brogue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Robert Williams, an Irishman, was a teacher at Greensburg.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Sharpless conducted an academy on Second Street, Philadelphia,
in 1791.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rev. S. Magaw opened an academy on Spruce Street in 1800.</p>

<p class='c007'>Philip Garrett and two other teachers opened a night school at
Philadelphia in 1799, and their advertisement stated it was “for
poor children and would do the teaching themselves.” Two years
later their effort was organized into the “Philadelphia Society for the
Establishment and Support of Charity Schools.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the settlement of New Londonderry, Chester County, Samuel
Blair, an Irishman, established a school in 1740. This settlement
was founded fourteen years before by immigrants from Derry and
Donegal. Blair is described in Pennsylvania history as “one of the
most able, learned, pious, excellent and venerable men of his day.”
His academy was called “the school of the prophets,” and “from it
there came forth many distinguished men who did honor to their
instructor and their country.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>One of the most eminent educators in the province was Dr. Samuel
Finley, who arrived from Ireland in 1734 and located in Pennsylvania,
where he taught school. In 1744 he founded an academy
at Nottingham, Md., where some of the most distinguished men in
the country laid the foundation of their education and usefulness.
Among his many scholars were such men as Governor Martin of
North Carolina, the famous Benjamin Rush of Philadelphia, his
brother, Judge Rush, Governor Henry of Maryland, and Doctor
McWhorter of New Jersey. It is said “there were no better classical
scholars formed anywhere in the county” than in this school. In
1761, Doctor Finley was appointed president of Princeton College.
He died in 1766.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Francis Alison, of Donegal, came to Pennsylvania in 1735,
and settled at New London, Chester County, where he opened a
school. At the time of its establishment there was a great want of
learning in the Middle Colonies, and Doctor Alison is said to have
instructed all who came to him “without fee or reward.” A Dr.
Patrick Allison, who was born in Lancaster County in 1740, is
thought to have been a relative of the Donegal schoolmaster. He
held a place “in the very first rank of the American clergy, and had
scarcely an equal for his eloquence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The father of John W. Geary, governor of Pennsylvania from
1867 to 1873, was an Irishman who had settled early in Franklin
County. He became an iron manufacturer, but having failed in
business and lost his entire investment in the mines, he opened a
select school in Westmoreland County, to which he devoted the
remaining years of his life. His son, General Geary, commanded
a Pennsylvania regiment in the Mexican War, and was commissioned
governor of Kansas in 1856. He fought in the War of the Rebellion
and distinguished himself for his bravery at Gettysburg. “His
name will forever be associated with the great events of the brilliant
Chattanooga campaign.” While in the command at Lookout Mountain,
his son, Capt. Edward Geary, a youth of eighteen, was killed
by his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Powers, who was elected a member of the Hibernian
Society of Philadelphia in 1790, is referred to in Campbell’s history
of that society as “a teacher in the university.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Benjamin Workman, who also joined in the same year, is described
as a teacher of mathematics. He advertised in the <cite>Freeman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Journal</cite> on June 28, 1786, as “from the University of Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rev. S. B. Wylie, a native of Moylarg, County Antrim, was a
teacher in a private academy at Philadelphia in 1797, in which year
he fled from the wrath of the British government. He was an early
member of the Society of United Irishmen in Belfast. He became
professor of languages in the University of Pennsylvania and was
vice-provost of that institution. He joined the Hibernian Society
in 1811.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Findlay, who was born in Ireland in 1750, came to Pennsylvania
in August, 1763, and taught school in Westmoreland County
for several years after his arrival. He was elected to the state Legislature
from Westmoreland County, and was a member of Congress
from 1791 to 1799, and again from 1803 to 1817. He was a prominent
writer and pamphleteer on subjects devoted to the public welfare.
He was a member of the Hibernian Society.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the members of the Hibernian Society who were elected in
1790, Francis Donnelly, John Barry, John Heffernan and James
Kidd are described as schoolmasters in Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Patrick Farrall, who joined the Society in 1792, and who is
described as “the first clerk in the office for settling accounts between
the United States and individual states” after independence had
been won, is thought to have been a Pennsylvania schoolmaster.</p>

<p class='c007'>Andrew Porter, a member of the Hibernian Society, opened “an
English and Mathematical School” in Philadelphia in 1767, in which
he taught till 1776, when he was appointed a captain of marines and
ordered to the frigate <em>Effingham</em>. He was a son of Robert Porter,
who emigrated from Derry to New Hampshire in 1720, and who
afterwards removed to Montgomery County, Pa. He was transferred
from the marine corps to the command of the Fourth Pennsylvania
Artillery, which post he held until the close of the war.
He fought in several battles of the Revolutionary War at the head
of his gallant regiment, and is said to have been personally commended
by Washington for his conduct at the battle of Germantown.
He became general of Pennsylvania militia, and took a prominent
part in all movements for the welfare of his native state. Gov.
David R. Porter of Pennsylvania, Gov. Bryan Porter of Michigan,
and James M. Porter, secretary of war under Tyler, were grandsons
of the exile from Derry, Robert Porter.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>EARLY IRISH IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='small'>BY FRANCIS J. WARD, ST. LOUIS.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In 1815 the population of St. Louis was 2,000. <cite>Billon’s Annals</cite>
for 1817–’20 states: “The adult male population of that day was
about 700. Of American birth 400, French and Spanish 150, and
of foreign birth 150. Of these, fully two thirds, or about 100, were
Irishmen, some fifteen or twenty European Frenchmen, about the
same number English and Scotch, and some ten or twelve Germans.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The tax list for 1811 shows Auguste Chouteau as the largest taxpayer,
the Irish-American firm, McKnight &amp; Brady, second. The
first directory of St. Louis (1821) contains 749 names. Of these
but few are Germanic. As late as 1827 there were but twenty-seven
German families here.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1663 Marquis de Tracy was governor-general of all the French
possessions in America, and another Franco-Irishman, Chevalier
McCarthy, in 1751, was commandant of the French settlement of
the Illinois territory, and in 1769 a native Gael, Alexander O’Reilly,
had command under the Spanish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Peter Conley appears as a witness to Laclede’s will. Charles Gratiot
was a member of the firm of David McCrae &amp; Co., at Cahokia,
from 1771 to 1781. Among the earliest mortgages in St. Louis is
that of Pierre Saffray to Joseph O’Neille. Mathew Kennedy, in
1771, executed a bond to Antoine Bernard, and in the will of Jan
Louis Lambert, a merchant, who died here in 1771, is found memoranda
of an indebtedness due Morrissey &amp; Co. Both Kennedy and
Morrissey were prominent merchants here long prior to this.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Patrick Henry, then governor of Virginia, determined to
check the progress of the English on the Western frontier, he gave
the command to the son of an Irishman, Gen. George Rogers Clark.
Virginia was unable to furnish the money to equip Clark’s troops
for the Illinois campaign, but an Irish merchant of New Orleans,
Oliver Pollock, borrowed $70,000 from Count O’Reilly, once commandant
of the Louisiana territory. What Morris did in the East
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Pollock did in the West for the American cause. To his financial
aid the United States owes the success of Clark’s Illinois campaign.
That Clark had many soldiers of Irish birth in his army is shown
by a deposition taken at Kaskaskia, June 11, 1779, in which are the
names of Andrew McDonald, Aaron Barrett, Patrick Shine, Andrew
Coil and Tarrance Mooney.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first American who settled in St. Louis after Clark’s surprise
of Kaskaskia, in 1778, was Philip Fine, son of Thomas Fine, an
Irish settler in Virginia. He came in 1781. Kaskaskia was the
settling place of many Irish in the early days, among them being
Robert Morrison, an Irish merchant, who arrived in 1792.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1800 occurred the murder of Adam Horne, on the Meramec.
The commandant at Carondelet appointed as witnesses to the inventory
John Cummings and John Donald, the witness to the order
being Bartholomew Harrington.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1803 Governor Delassus organized two companies of militia
for the protection of New Madrid, and appointed Richard Waters,
captain, and George K. Reagan, lieutenant of cavalry, and Robert
McCoy, captain, and John Hart, ensign of infantry. William Sullivan
obtained the first tavern license issued in the town after its
transfer to the Americans, and was appointed by General Harrison
constable and coroner, holding in the latter capacity the first inquest.
In 1816, when Chouteau laid out the first addition to the town, Sullivan
purchased a half block, on which he built a residence, where
he died.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately after the transfer of the territory, Colonel Delassus
addressed an official note to the new American officials commending,
among others, the following officers who had served under him in
the French service: James Mackay, commandant at St. Andrew, “an
officer of knowledge, zealous and punctual”; also Mr. Mathew McKonel,
Robert McKay, “a brave officer,” and Dr. Samuel Dorsey,
surgeon of the fort.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the transfer came the descendants of Irish settlers of Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Kentucky, the Carolinas and Tennessee, a sturdy,
vigorous, independent and progressive race, to whom President
Roosevelt, himself a descendant on the maternal side, pays tribute
in his <cite>Winning of the West</cite>. The fathers of many of them took
part in the Revolutionary War, others were those who were banished
from Ireland through the same laws that forced Americans to rebel.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Among the latter was Joseph Charless, a native of Westmeath,
who sought his fellow refugees, Mathew Carey and William Duane,
in Philadelphia. He worked as a compositor on Duane’s <cite>Aurora</cite>,
and set up for Carey the first folio edition of the Bible printed in
the United States. Shortly afterward he left for Kentucky, coming
later with his printer’s outfit on mulebacks to St. Louis, where he
began the publication of the first newspaper printed west of the
Mississippi, the <cite>Missouri Gazette</cite>, in 1808.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1804 came John Mullanphy, the celebrated philanthropist.
His third daughter, Jane, married Charles Chambers, son of John
Chambers, a United Irishman, who, with Thomas Addis Emmet,
Dr. William Macneven and thirteen others, after their release from
a political prison, came to America, where they rose to distinction.</p>

<p class='c007'>James Rankin was the first sheriff of St. Louis under American
rule, and the first grand jury contains some Irish names, and many
transfers of real estate from early settlers are recorded this year,
among them that of Manuel Lisa to Patrick Cullen and Joseph Bent.
Eighteen hundred and four was the year when the old Fort Bellefontaine
was selected for the establishment of Jefferson Barracks,
which, after its abandonment, in 1826, was left in charge of Capt.
John Whistler, a native of Ireland, founder of Fort Dearborn, in
1803, now the city of Chicago, and grandfather of the famous
American artist, James A. McNeil Whistler. He died in St. Louis
in 1829.</p>

<p class='c007'>This year also saw the departure of Lewis and Clark to the Rocky
Mountains, Clark being a brother to Gen. Rogers Clark. Among
the party were George Shannon, who afterward became United
States attorney for Missouri, and Patrick Gass.</p>

<p class='c007'>A remarkable Irishman came in 1805—Jeremiah Conners. In
1818 he was the owner of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">40–arpent</span> lots, on which he laid out
Washington Avenue. Part of his property he donated to Bishop
Dubourg, in 1820, for founding St. Louis University, the first of
its kind in St. Louis. At his house was organized the first Irish
society established in the city, in 1818.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Christy, whose people came from County Down, was also
a famous man. He laid out the whole section known as North St.
Louis. Another large Irish landholder was Patrick McMasters Dillon,
who, previous to leaving Ireland, was involved in the Emmet
rising. He laid out several additions to the city on lands he purchased,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>his last being “Dillon’s Fourth Addition,” in 1840, on a
tract purchased from Fred Dent, father-in-law of President Grant.
One of his daughters, Martha N., married the celebrated Capt.
James B. Eads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among other large purchasers of real estate in the early years
occur the names of James Mackay, James Conway, Mathew Boyse,
John Hogan, Hugh O’Neill and John Dougherty. A famous lawyer
of this time was Col. Luke E. Lawless, a native of Dublin, who
came in 1816, and who, after the resignation of Judge William C.
Carr from the Circuit Court, succeeded him. Still another was
Nathaniel Beverly Tucker. He became judge of the Circuit Court.
One of the family married John Patten Emmet, youngest son of
Thomas Addis Emmet, who was appointed professor of chemistry
in the University of Virginia by Thomas Jefferson, the son of the
union being the celebrated Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet of New York.
Another legal luminary was Hamilton Rowan Gamble, whose people
came from Belfast. In 1861 he was chosen provisional governor of
the state.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first House of Representatives of the territory, S. McGrady
represented Ste. Genevieve. In the legislative council occurs the
name of James Flaugherty. William Neeley became president of
the council. The first state Legislature met in the Missouri Hotel,
built by Thomas Brady, a famous Irishman of his day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Col. John O’Fallon, son of Dr. James O’Fallon, native of County
Roscommon, surgeon under Washington, came in 1811, and resided
with his uncle, General Clark. The name has become so identified
with the history of the city as to need no mention. Francis Redford
opened, in 1804, the first school for instruction in English.
The honor of giving the grounds for its first seat of learning
belongs to a native of the Emerald Isle. The proud distinction of
being called the “Father of the University of Missouri” belongs to a
man whose ancestors came from the County Tyrone, Dr. James
Rollins.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first bank, the Bank of St. Louis, organized in 1813, had as
one of its commissioners Thomas Brady, and the second, the Bank
of Missouri, had among its directors John McKnight and Mathew
Kerr, and the Bank of the State of Missouri, organized in 1837, had
among its directors Hugh O’Neill, Edward Walsh, Edward Dobyns
and John O’Fallon. A branch of the United States Bank was
started in 1819, with John O’Fallon as president.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The Merchants’ Exchange began as a debating Society, in 1836,
with Edward Tracy as president and John Ford as secretary. The
Millers’ Association, the first of its kind in the West, was established
in 1849, among the members being John Walsh. Financial
exchanges need telegraphic connections, so along came a Leitrim
man, Henry O’Reilly, in 1847, who opened here the first telegraph
office west of the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c007'>In military life the men of the “Fighting Race” were to the fore.
The St. Louis Grays, the first volunteer organization, started in 1832,
had for its ensign John P. Riley, but a volunteer company of light
infantry preceded it in 1819, having for its captain Henry W. Conway.
Other companies were added to the Grays in 1842, forming
the First Regiment, St. Louis Legion, among the designations of the
companies being “Montgomery Guards,” with Patrick Gorman, captain;
“St. Louis Guards,” Daniel Byrne, captain; “Mound City
Guards,” John H. Barrett, captain; “Morgan Riflemen,” Henry J.
McKillop, captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this review of the “pioneer” Irish in St. Louis, many names
necessarily are omitted. Sufficient to mention men of worth in their
day, such as John C. Sullivan, collector, in 1814; Judge Thomas
McGuire, 1817; Captain McGunnegle, the Rankin Brothers, Hugh,
Robert and David, who came hither from Ireland in 1819; Bernard
Gillully, who was in partnership with Edward C. Cummings; James
Clemens, Patrick Walsh, Richard K. Dowling, Thomas Hanley,
Thomas M. Doherty, Mayor Ferguson, William Carr Lane, Bryan
Mullanphy, and others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such men, indeed, were the “cream of St. Louis society” in the
early part of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c007'>We hear much of the part played by the Irish in the creation and
maintenance of the American republic in the military sense, but
what they have contributed towards its civil, commercial, manufacturing
or educational development is much overlooked and remains
unknown to readers of the present day.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='small'>Editorial in the <cite>Irish-American</cite>, New York, October 14, 1905.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. On page 121, Vol. V, Journal of the American-Irish Historical Society: “Thomas
the Irishman” is mentioned as in the Dutch records of New York. Thus, Hon. Peter
Stuyvesant, Director-General of New Netherland, writing to Capt. Martin Cregier, 1663,
says: “Your letter by Thomas the Irishman has just been received.”&nbsp;... On August
5, 1663, Captain Cregier writes in his journal: “Thomas the Irishman arrived here at
the Redoubt from the Manhatans.” On September 1, 1663, Captain Cregier writes:
“Thomas the Irishman and Claesje Hoorn arrived with their yachts at the Kill from
the Manhatan,” and on the 17th of the same month the captain writes: “Thomas the
Irishman arrived today.” The foregoing references may be found in <cite>Documents Relating
to the Colonial History of the State of New York</cite>, edited by Fernow, Vol. XIII,
Albany, 1881.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the preparation for an exhaustive history of early New York
Mr. Dingman Versteeg, archivist of the Holland Society, has been
able to trace out many heretofore lacking details of the record of the
Irishman who was so prominent here in Governor Stuyvesant’s time.</p>

<p class='c007'>His name was Thomas Lewis, and he must have gone to Holland
from Ireland some time previous to 1657. How long he remained
there does not appear, but, in that year, he was sent from Amsterdam
under contract to the Dutch West Indies Company as a carpenter to
New Amsterdam, as this city (New York) was then called. His
name was transformed in the records to Thomas Lodewicksen, a sort
of Latin-Dutch combination.</p>

<p class='c007'>For three years after this he does not seem to have made much
stir here, and then he appears as the captain of a bark plying between
this city and Albany. A man of such standing in this community at
that time was a real captain of industry and a citizen of substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The favor and regard in which Lewis was held by Governor Stuyvesant
is evidenced by the fact that his bark was used to transport
troops in the Esopus war of 1663, and on it Stuyvesant made his
headquarters, so dating a number of letters still extant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lewis was married to a Dutch wife, Geesje Barents, a member of a
prominent and well-known family in this city. He had several
children. One of them, Thomas Lodewicksen, Jr., married Frances,
daughter of the famous Jacob Leisler, head of the colony, which is
another indication of his father’s social prominence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Lewis died here, on September 14, 1685, and his widow was named
executrix of his will by Governor Dongan, April 1, 1686. There
are many of his descendants among the various Lewis families scattered
over this state, but few of them, perhaps, know that their
ancestor was that “Thomas the Irishman” mentioned so frequently
in the old Dutch records of Stuyvesant’s time.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>AN INTERESTING PIONEER FAMILY.</h3>

<p class='c006'>James and Isaac Savage and their two sisters, came to America
from Ireland. Afterward, about 1763, their father, James Savage,
being then an aged man, came to this country to Newton, Mass.,
where the two daughters had settled. There he died and was buried.</p>

<p class='c007'>His sons, James and Isaac, settled at Woolwich, Me., where James
was early killed by the Indians. Isaac married and had a large
family. His wife’s name is not known. Among their children was
a son, who settled at Wiscasset, Me., another son who settled at
Woolwich and another son, James, who also settled at Wiscasset.

  <h3 class='c001'>EDWARD O’BRIEN’S SCHOOL DICTIONARY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>An interesting historical paragraph recently contributed, states
that in 1798 Edward O’Brien printed in New Haven, Conn., his
“School Dictionary: Being a compendium of the latest and most
improved dictionaries,” which exists in two copies—the British
Museum copy (perfect) and the Yale College Library copy (lacking
ten pages). This was the first dictionary by an American author
published in this country. It has no date, but is thought to have
been issued towards the end of 1798. Its author, who taught school
in Guilford, Conn., was born there March 10, 1757, and died there
August 20, 1836. Soon after its publication its author and the Rev.
John Elliott (1768–1824, great-great-grandson of John Elliott, the
Indian apostle) prepared the second American dictionary, which was
copyrighted in June, 1799, and published in January, 1800.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>A PATRIOT OF THE REVOLUTION.</h3>

<p class='c006'>James Stevenson, a native of Ireland, was born in 1750 and was
brought to this country when a child. During the Revolutionary
War he served as a sergeant in Colonel Evans’ Pennsylvania regiment,
was captured by the enemy and held for a year in the notorious
British prison ships.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the war he married Hannah Bull, a daughter of Col. John
Bull, of Chester County, Pa., a soldier of the Revolution. They
removed to Lawrence County, Pa., Mr. Stevenson dying in Poland,
Ohio, in 1834. He left many descendants and a society has been
formed among them. It holds annual reunions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among his descendants may be mentioned: John H. Stevenson, of
Allegheny; Prof. William M. Stevenson, of Pittsburg; Rev. Frank
B. Stevenson, of New Castle; Dr. Silas Stevenson; James A. Stevenson
and E. S. Stevenson, of New Castle; T. D. Stevenson, of
New Bedford, Pa.; Mrs. Rebecca Stevenson Neal, of Pulaski, Pa.;
Capt. Thomas S. Calhoun, of Georgetown, Pa.; Thomas S. McCready,
of Manchester, Kas.; Homer A. McCready, of Hancock

  <h3 class='c001'>THE HALEYS OF THE ISLES OF SHOALS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Andrew Haley was of the Isles of Shoals. He was of Irish blood
and had a son, Andrew, who married Elizabeth Scammon, of Kittery,
Me., in 1697. Andrew Haley, Sr., early settled on the islands and
eventually became styled “King of the Shoals.” He and his descendants
seem to have long occupied that portion of the Shoals known
as Haley’s Island. In the <cite>Collections of the Massachusetts Historical
Society</cite>, for 1800, is a paper descriptive of the Shoals, from which
paper we extract the following: “The only secure harbour in these
islands is Haley’s, which opens to the S. W., having Haley’s island
S. E., Malaga N. W., a wall built by Mr. Haley, between 70 and 80
paces in length, on the N. E.... At the close of the year 1800
there were on Haley’s island, three decent dwelling houses, occupied
by Mr. Haley, an ingenious and respectable old gentleman of seventy-six,
and his two sons, with their families. Mr. Haley has expended
a handsome fortune in erecting the expensive wall before mentioned,
wharves, and other useful works. Among these are a windmill, rope
walk, 270 feet long; salt works erected before the war [Revolution],
a bake house, brewery, distillery, built in 1783, and a blacksmith’s
and cooper’s shop.”</p>

<h3 class='c001'>THE IMPORTATION OF IRISH BUTTER.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Long before the Revolution, and long after that period, Irish pork
and butter were imported to this country in great quantities. A Boston
paper publishes the following letter, which was dated October 29,
1763, and sent from a leading firm in Boston to parties in Ireland:
“This is to Desire you will as soon as possible &amp; without Fail
Ship us from Cork 250 Barrels Best Irish Pork &amp; 100 Firkins of
good Irish Butter, the weight of each Barrell of Pork to be mark’d on

<h3 class='c001'>THE DISTRICT KNOWN AS IRISH TRACT.</h3>

<p class='c006'>A Moravian missionary who went from Pennsylvania to Georgia,
in 1743–’44, writes that while in the lower valley of Virginia: “I
asked him (Joist Hite) for the way to Carolina. He told me of
one which runs for 150 miles through Irish settlements, the district
being known as Irish tract.”—(<cite>Virginia Magazine of History and
Biography</cite>, October, 1904.)</p>

<h3 class='c001'>TWO INTERESTING HISTORICAL FRAGMENTS.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Barnabas Palmer, of Rochester, N. H., was born in Cork or Limerick,
1725, emigrated from there with two brothers, and enlisted
under Sir William Pepperill. Barnabas sailed from Portsmouth,
N. H.,—one of the force of 3,000 men, 1745, and on the Isle of Cape
Breton, under Fort Louisburg, left his right arm. Subsequently he
settled in Rochester, N. H., married, had fourteen children, and was
a member of the General Court of New Hampshire that ratified the
Constitution of the United States. Here is another fragment of history:
Lieutenant-General Pepperrell, in 1745, ordered Maj. John
Stover to organize a company at Wells, Me., for the Louisburg expedition.
The order was promptly carried out. Among the volunteers
were Edward Welch, John Conaway, James Gillpatrick, John
McDaniel, James Read, Michael Wilson and John Burks (Burke?).
They sailed March 24, 1745, for Cape Breton. Some of the company
died there. In the fall of 1745 most of the survivors returned
to Wells.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>WORKMEN FIND AN INTERESTING COIN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Workmen who were digging in Congress Street [Boston] the other
day found an interesting old coin which is said by experts to link the
records of Boston currency nearly two centuries ago with a mintage
controversy that stirred even the phlegmatic George III, and elicited
some of the most famous witticisms of Dean Swift and dignified
declarations of Sir Isaac Newton. It is about one third larger than
an American quarter and has on the obverse side an idealized head
of George III, in the center, surrounded with the words “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Georgius
Deo Gratia Rex</span>.” Perhaps the intrinsic interest is in the reverse
side, which has in the center a symbolic figure of Ireland, bearing a
harp, and on the border is stamped “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hibernia—1723</span>.” The first
anomaly in this is that, although it was on its face an Irish coin, it
was neither coined nor circulated in that country, but, owing to indignant
protests of Irish dealers, crystallized by the sarcasms of that
witty divine, Dean Swift, it was shipped over to Boston, where it circulated
as the “colonial half-penny.” In the old country it was
called the “Woods half-penny,” on account of its coinage by a Londoner
of that name. This was the chief element of grievance, as
Ireland was then approaching the time when the aspiration of a
Grattan were to find realization, and Swift argued in his famous
Drapier letters that the country should not have these foreign and
false coins passed upon it.—(<cite>Boston Transcript</cite>, October 12, 1895.)</p>

<h3 class='c001'>DENNIS MACCARTY OF WARREN, R. I.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='small'>BY MISS VIRGINIA BAKER, OF WARREN.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Since I forwarded the data relating to Dennis and William Mackarty,
I have again examined the probate records of this town, and
have made the discovery that the will of Dennis Maccarty of Warren
was probated November 7, 1757. As Dennis of Bristol did not
die until 1760, it follows that there must have been living in Bristol
County two men bearing the same name, both of whom served in the
French wars.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>I enclose a copy of the will of Dennis of Warren. In 1757, Warren,
as you know, included Barrington. You will notice that the
legatees mentioned in the will were all Barrington men; therefore, I
conclude that that Dennis resided in the west section of the town.
Again, the testator mentions no kindred, while Dennis of Bristol had
a wife and son. Here is the will mentioned:</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the Name of God Amen I Dennis Maccarty of Warren in the

<h3 class='c001'>THE VOYAGE OF THE SEAFLOWER.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='small'>From <cite>The Recorder</cite> (I. A. H. S.), February, 1902.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The sloop <em>Seaflower</em> left Belfast, Ireland, July 10, 1741, bound
for Philadelphia, in the province of Pennsylvania. She had 106
persons aboard, mainly emigrants.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Seaflower</em> was owned by Joseph Thompson of New Haven,
Conn., and Capt. Ebenezer Clark, master of the sloop. Thompson
owned three fourths and Clark the remainder. When about two
weeks out, Captain Clark, the master, sickened and died and the mate
was also taken ill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus began a reign of suffering, wretchedness and misery that has
seldom been surpassed in the annals of ocean voyages. Some time
after the master’s death the sloop sprung her mast and to add to the
horrors of the voyage the supply of water and provisions began to
run low.</p>

<p class='c007'>The accident to the mast, the sickness and other troubles greatly
extended the voyage so that long before the American coast was
sighted many of the ship’s company and passengers had perished of
hunger.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to sustain life the living were driven to feed on the dead.
Six bodies had been thus consumed and the seventh was being cut up
when the <em>Success</em>, man-of-war, came alongside and her captain supplied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the well-nigh crazed survivors of the <em>Seaflower</em> with provisions
sufficient to bring them into port.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now to account for this fearful voyage: It is possible that the
sloop was overcrowded on leaving Belfast; also that a miscalculation
had been made as to the probable length of time that would be required
for the voyage, this leading to an inadequate supply of water
and provisions. The death of the master and the illness of the mate
likewise had a decided tendency to complicate matters. When the
food supply was at length exhausted, and the last drop of water
gone, thirst was added to the horrors of hunger. With the vessel
still many leagues from land, the awful sufferings of passengers and
crew can be imagined, not described.</p>

<p class='c007'>Forty-six died on the passage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Seaflower</em> cast anchor in Boston Harbor, October 31, sixteen
weeks having elapsed since she sailed from Ireland. On the date
mentioned, October 31, 1741, the selectmen of Boston convened in
session, there being present: Captain Forsyth, Caleb Lyman, Jonas
Clark, Mr. Hancock, Mr. Cook and Captain Steel. At this meeting
was considered “The sloop <em>Seaflower</em> this day arrived from Belfast,
Ebenezer Clark, late master, with 65 passengrs on board....”
The following minute was recorded, viz., that</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whereas a Sloop from Ireland with a number of Passengers on
board being arrived in this Harbour &amp; apprehending danger may
acrue to the Inhabitants by reason of the Hardships the People have
Suffered in their Passage being obliged to eat some of their People
to Sustain Life, Voted That the Select Men View the State of the
Persons on board with Doct<sup>r</sup> Clark &amp; Report what Circumstances
they are in....”</p>

<p class='c007'>The selectmen accordingly visited the afflicted survivors of the
<em>Seaflower</em> and found the facts as here outlined. So serious was the
case, that the Selectmen again met on November 2 and decided to
wait on the governor and council to acquaint them with the conditions
and see what could be done. The same day, November 2, a
meeting of the governor and council was held in the council chamber
in Boston, the selectmen appeared, stated their case and sought
advice.</p>

<p class='c007'>They declared that about thirty of the passengers were in “very
low circumstances &amp; not able of taking care of themselves, but
require the speediest care to preserve life.” The selectmen prayed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“that suitable provision may be made for them or else they must
perish.” The governor and council accordingly</p>

<p class='c007'>Ordered that the selectmen secure the papers belonging to the
owners and last master, with the goods aboard and dispose of the
servants and passengers in hospital on Rainsford’s island, where they
were to be supported and nursed. It was also ordered that the
“owners of the said Sloop” be speedily advised of existing conditions
and requested to come to Boston, “pay the Charges herein expended
&amp; take all further Care in the Premisses as shall be necessary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The selectmen thereupon sent an express to Joseph Thompson, of
New Haven, asking him to repair to Boston and take charge of the
<em>Seaflower</em> and servants. They likewise directed the town clerk of
Boston to write to Mr. Thompson. The selectmen also voted that
Captain Forsyth and Captain Steel of their number be a committee
to go aboard the sloop and take an account of the papers, etc., and
secure them, Mr. Savell to see that the unfortunate people were supplied
with all things necessary to their comfort until the vessel was
taken to Rainsford’s island. Mr. Ball was directed to take the
sloop there as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Tuesday morning, the vessel and passengers were taken over
to the island “with the help of Capt. Tyng &amp; his People who came
in the long boat &amp; other persons.” The passengers were all carried
ashore and lodged in the hospital. Doctor Clark gave directions for
the treatment of the patients, and men were put in charge of the
vessel and the goods aboard.</p>

<p class='c007'>The selectmen met again on November 16. Mr. Thompson of New
Haven appeared and stated that he owned three fourths of the sloop
and that Ebenezer Clark, the deceased master, owned the rest. He
asked that the vessel’s papers he delivered to him and this was done.
Thompson and Captain Steel, the latter one of the selectmen,
assumed all the charges incurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts briefly stated herein have been obtained from the minutes
of the selectmen of Boston as reproduced in printed form by
the record commissioners of that city.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>THE STORY OF MISS FITZGERALD.</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='small'>From <cite>The Recorder</cite> (A. I. H. S.), Boston, Mass., December, 1901.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Portsmouth, R. I., was settled in 1638. Nine years later it was the
most populous town in the colony. Here Eleazar Slocum was born
on the “25th day of the 10th month 1664.” He resided there until
some twenty years of age when he removed to Dartmouth Township,
now included in the city of New Bedford, Mass.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Dartmouth he wedded an Irish girl named Elephell Fitzgerald.
Concerning her there are two theories. The first is that she
was the daughter of an Irish earl and came to this country with
her sister, who was eloping with an English officer. The second theory
is that favored by Charles E. Slocum, M. D. Ph. D. In his
<cite>History of the Slocums</cite> he inclines to the belief that Miss Fitzgerald
was one of those Irish maidens who were shipped to New England
in Cromwell’s time or at later periods.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were doubtless large numbers of these Irish girls brought
over. The majority of them were, without question, Roman Catholics.
Frequently their fate was a hard and cruel one. Thebaud,
in his <cite>Irish Race in the Past and the Present</cite>, writing on the subject
says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Such of them as were sent North were to be distributed among
the ‘saints’ of New England, to be esteemed by the said ‘saints’ as
‘idolaters,’ ‘vipers,’ ‘young reprobates,’ just objects of ‘the wrath of
God’; or, if appearing to fall in with their new and hard task-masters,
to be greeted with words of dubious praise as ‘brands snatched
from the burning,’ ‘vessels of reprobation,’ destined, perhaps, by a
due initiation of the ‘saints’ to become ‘vessels of election,’ in the
meantime to be unmercifully scourged with the ‘besom of righteousness,’
at the slightest fault or mistake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some, however, met a better fate. Their lines fell in more fortunate
places. In many cases they were kindly treated and, in time,
married into the families of their recent masters. Some of them, too,
reared large families of manly sons and womanly daughters and lived
to a happy old age. Many of their descendants must exist today
in high places. Perhaps some are not aware of their maternal Irish
descent, while a few may be reluctant to acknowledge it if they are.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Yet, many of these Irish girls were descended from the old nobility
and clansmen whose names and fames had ranked with the most
illustrious in Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Fitzgerald’s marriage to Eleazar Slocum took place about
1687. Their children were Meribah, born in 1689; Mary, born
1691; Eleazar, born in 1693–’94; John, 1696–’97; Benjamin, 1699,
and Joanna, 1702. There was also another child named Ebenezer.
In 1699 the husband and father is recorded as giving £3 toward
building a Quaker meeting house. His will was proved in 1727.
It makes the following provisions concerning his wife:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Item—I give and bequeath Elephell, my beloved wife, the sum
of twenty pounds [per] annum of Good and Lawful money of New
England, to be paid Yearly and Every Year By my Execut<sup>rs</sup> During
her Naturall life—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Item—I give and bequeath to Elephell my beloved wife an Indian
girl named Dorcas During the time she hath to Serve by Indenture—she
fulfilling all articles on my behalf—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Item—I give and Bequeath to Elephell my beloved wife, The
great low room of my Dwelling house with the two bedrooms belonging
together with the Chamber over it and the Bedrooms belonging
thereto, and the Garrett and also what part of the N<sup>w</sup> Addition she
shall Choose and one half of the cellar, During her Naturall life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Item—I will that my executors procure and supply Elephell my
wife with firewood sufficient During her Naturall life, And whatsoever
Provisions and Corn shall be left after my Decease, I give to
Elephell my wife for her support, and also the hay for Support of
the Cattle. The above gifts and Bequests is all and what I intend
for Elephell my wife instead of her thirds or Dowry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To his son Eleazar he bequeathed the northerly part of the homestead
farm, 100 acres, with house, barns, orchard, etc.; to son
Ebenezer, the southerly part of the homestead farm “on which my
dwelling house stands.” To Eleazar and Ebenezer he also gives
other lands, and to Ebenezer, in addition one pair of oxen, a pair of
steers, eight cows, two heifers and £12. The remainder of the horses,
cattle, etc., he gives to Eleazar and Ebenezer. The inventory shows
£5,790 18s 11d personal estate.</p>

<p class='c007'>His widow, Elephell (Fitzgerald) Slocum, made a will “the 19th
day of the first month called March 1745–6.” It was proved October
4, 1748. Joanna, one of her daughters, married Daniel, son of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>John Weeden of Jamestown, R. I. A son of theirs was named
Gideon Slocum Weeden.</p>

<p class='c007'>The late Esther B. Carpenter of Wakefield, R. I., author of a delightful
volume of sketches entitled <cite>South County Neighbors</cite>, once
alluded to Miss Fitzgerald in a note to the writer. Miss Carpenter
said that she remembered to have heard her maternal grandmother
say that she valued her Irish line of descent from Miss Fitzgerald
above any other she could claim. This Irish connection had always
been a common remark in the family. The grandmother in question
had named one of her daughters Alice Joanna after her Irish ancestress,
whose daughter Joanna had married a Weeden as already
stated. Many of the Weeden, Slocum and other families now in
Rhode Island trace descent back to Elephell, the gentle Irish girl.
Descendants of Elephell (Fitzgerald) Slocum are found today in
New Bedford, Mass. The writer recently conversed with one of
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have determined to hold this place, and, by heavens, we can.”
This was the closing sentence of a military despatch written on the
night of July 29, 1813. It was penned in the commandant’s room of

to this remarkable despatch was an order removing Major Croghan
from command and ordering him to report to headquarters under
virtual arrest for disobedience.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Croghan responded promptly, traversing a dangerous
country. Face to face with his general he explained that it was not
braggadocio that inspired the language of his message. When it
was written it was expected that it would fall into the hands of the
enemy, then boastfully advancing to the attack. With the warlike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>eloquence that came as heritage from his Irish ancestors, Major Croghan
showed his general that it was too late to retreat from the fort,
and that it was a necessary military maneuver to hold it pending the
execution of other movements. His tongue won for him what every
great soul desires—opportunity. Restored to command, he returned
to the fort and won a victory that will forever live in the annals of
the early republic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not long ago the body of Major Croghan was interred at the
base of the monument erected to the memory of the soldiers of Sandusky
County. This imposing shaft marks the site of the old fort
where the dead hero won his laurels and where the blow was struck
that opened the way to ultimate victory over the British and Indian
power in the northwestern country. Over his grave will stand as a
silent witness the single cannon used in defense of the fort, an ancient
six-pounder, which wears the affectionate feminine sobriquet of
“Old Betsy.” It was a single belch from the iron jaws of this that
decided the fate of the battle, and though inanimate, still it deserved
a share of the glory that surrounded the interment of the gallant
Croghan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since that eventful day in August many great events have occurred
to fill the pages of history. General Harrison became greater and
filled the president’s chair. Around the base of the old fort a city
has sprung up named after Gen. John C. Fremont, the Pathfinder.
In Croghan’s day the little settlement was known as Lower Sandusky,
to distinguish it from the city in Wyandot County known as Upper
Sandusky. So powerful a pleader as Rutherford B. Hayes, then a
practising attorney at the Sandusky County bar, and afterward president
of the United States, pleaded that the old name be permitted
to stand.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was pomp and ceremony to mark the final sepulture of the
old commander’s dust in the ground that he hallowed with his victory,
but no greater tribute could be paid to his soldier memory than
to tell again the story of the battle. He came of fighting stock,
this young American soldier. The blood of “Kelly, Burke and Shea”
flowed in his veins and he smelled the battle from afar off. His father
was William Croghan, an Irishman, born in Dublin in 1752, but
who was well settled in this country when the War of the Revolution
broke out. He fought at Monmouth, Brandywine and Germantown,
and froze with the rest of the immortal band at Valley Forge.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Joining in the drift from the Virginias across the mountains, he
reached the settlement at the falls of the Ohio, where Louisville now
stands. In 1791 he married Lucy Clark, sister of George Rogers
Clark, the mighty figure of the Vincennes campaign, who saved an
empire to the American republic. Another brother, William, was the
Clark who, with Captain Lewis, made the historic exploration tour
across the then unknown continent. Of such a union was born the
man whom a state and a nation afterward honored for bravery. The
exact place of his birth was at Locust Grove, Ky., a few miles below
Louisville. When but twenty years of age he gained distinction at
the battle of Tippecanoe, and was promoted to a captaincy in March,
1812, being detailed as aide-de-camp to General Harrison, with the
rank of major. This was his condition when the events that were to
make him famous began to unfold themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indians, under Tecumseh, and the British, under General
Proctor, had raised the siege of Fort Meigs, in what is now Wood
County, and were coming toward the post at Upper Sandusky and
Seneca. The British sailed around into Sandusky Bay, while their
Indian allies marched across through the swamps and marshes of the
Portage River. They expected to meet and make a combined attack
upon Lower Sandusky while Harrison was engaged in protecting
Forts Winchester and Meigs. The work known as Fort Stephenson
was in reality an old stockade used for storage purposes, and inclosed
an acre of ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Examination by Harrison some days before the allies invested Fort
Meigs showed that the stockade was commanded by a hill to the
southeast. It was not strong enough to resist heavy artillery, and
only 200 men could be accommodated as a garrison. Croghan was
left in charge, with orders that if the British approached by water,
which carried the presumption that if they had their heavy artillery,
he was to retreat, if possible, destroying both the fort and the public
stores. If only the Indians came he was to stand fast, as retreat
through these wary hostiles was an impossibility and a defense was a
certainty.</p>

<p class='c007'>On July 29 Harrison received word that the siege of Fort Meigs
had been raised and that it seemed the intention of the allies to descend
upon either Sandusky or Seneca. At a council of war held
that night it was decided that Fort Stephenson was untenable and
orders were sent to Major Croghan to carry out his original instructions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>This order did not reach Croghan until the next morning at
eleven o’clock. A council of his officers reached the decision that it
was too late to retreat and the famous note was sent and the meeting
with Harrison arranged. On August 1 the advance guard of the
enemy was seen on the hill over the river. They were the fleet-footed
Indians who had been observed by a reconnoitering party from headquarters
the day before. There was but one piece of artillery in the
fort, “Old Betsey,” and it was promptly fired, causing the redskins
to retire. Within a half hour the British gunboats, a part of Commodore
Barclay’s fleet, hove into sight. A landing was effected a half
mile below the fort and a howitzer disembarked and mounted.</p>

<p class='c007'>A British officer, Major Chambers, with a flag of truce, was sent
forward and was met by Ensign Shipp, of the Seventeenth Regiment.
The visitor demanded in the name of General Proctor the immediate
surrender of the fort. The Americans were warned that it would be
almost impossible to restrain the Indians in case of success, and that
the whole garrison would be slain. The gallant answer was returned
that the Indians would find no one to massacre when the fort fell, for
every man had sworn to die before surrender.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle then opened, the gunboats, the land battery, five hundred
Wellington veterans and eight hundred Indians joining in the attack.
Throughout the evening Croghan fired his six pounder in a desultory
way, moving it from place to place to make it appear that he had more
artillery. Ascertaining from the enemy’s fire that the northwestern
angle of the fort was to be reached, he made preparation to checkmate
his plans. During the night the gun was removed to a block house
which commanded that angle and the embrasure was masked. The
piece itself was loaded with grape and slugs. Croghan’s foresight
was vindicated when the next day additional artillery was landed and
the hammering of the doomed angle was renewed. The shaking wall
was reinforced with bags of sand and even of flour, making it capable
of resisting the pounding. On the evening of August 2 the grand
assault was launched, Colonel Short leading the principal column.</p>

<p class='c007'>He rallied his men with great bravery under a destructive rifle fire
and gained the ditch beneath the stockade walls. There he ordered
his men to cut down the pickets and give the Americans no quarter.
At the proper second of time the masked embrasure was thrown open
and the slug-charged cannon was permitted to belch its death-dealing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>contents into the close packed mass of soldiers at short range. Few
escaped this destructive fire. Colonel Short was killed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second column, led by Major Chambers and Colonel Warburton,
was also defeated by the line in charge of Captain Hunter.
When night came the enemy withdrew in a disorderly fashion, leaving
behind them one of their gunboats, some of the wounded, much ammunition
and many guns. At nine o’clock the next morning, Major
Croghan sent an express to Harrison announcing his victory and the
retirement of the defeated enemy. The defenders of the fort lost
only one killed and seven wounded of the 100 men who answered roll
call. Ten times that number opposed them, and 2,000 more were in
reserve near Fort Meigs to cut off any reinforcement from that direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his official report of the battle Harrison said: “It will not be
among the least of Proctor’s mortifications that he has been baffled
by a youth who has just passed his twenty-first year. He is, however,
a hero worthy of his gallant uncle, Gen. George Rogers Clark.”
The brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel was at once conferred upon the
young hero by the president of the United States, and he was presented
with a sword by the ladies of Chillicothe. Of this victory,
Gen. W. T. Sherman, writing from the standpoint of a military expert,
said: “The defense of Fort Stephenson by Croghan and his
gallant little band was the necessary precursor to Perry’s victory on
the lake and of Harrison’s triumphant victory on the Thames.
These assured our immediate ancestors the mastery of the great
West, and from that day to this the West has been the bulwark of
the nation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The following year saw him made a full lieutenant-colonel. He
served with distinction until 1817, when he resigned and went to New
Orleans to live. He was made postmaster of that city in 1824.
Some years later he was appointed inspector general of the army, and
in 1835 he was voted a gold medal by Congress in recognition of his
fight of twenty-two years before.</p>

<p class='c007'>He died on January 8, 1849, while the guns were thundering their
salutes in honor of another great victory, that of General Jackson,
another Irishman’s son, over Packenham and the British below New
Orleans in 1814. His body was removed to the old family burying
ground at Locust Grove and buried near that of his famous uncle,
where they were found last June by Maj. Webb C. Hayes, acting for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the Fremont Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution,
which is named after Major Croghan.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were removed to Fremont on June 10, and were placed temporarily
in the vault at Oakwood Cemetery. The pall-bearers were
five venerable survivors of the Mexican War who had enlisted in Sandusky
County. The youngest was seventy-seven years of age and the
oldest eighty-five. As Croghan was inspector-general of the army
during the Mexican War, they can be said to have served under him.
The dead hero left three children. His only son, St. George Croghan,
died on the field early in the Civil War, wearing the gray of the
Confederate army. A grandson, also George Croghan, survives, and
there are other descendants on the distaff side.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Daughters of the American Revolution have erected on the
British redoubt 250 yards northwest of Fort Stephenson a tablet commemorating
the fact that it was there that the cannon from Commodore
Barclay’s fleet thundered against Croghan’s walls. Exultingly
the fact is proclaimed that Barclay was afterward wounded and his
entire fleet, including the cannon which had been used against Fort
Stephenson, was captured by Commodore Perry at the battle of Lake
Erie in the following September.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>IRISH SETTLERS ON THE OPEQUAN.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='small'>Compiled from an Article by “Iveagh,” in the <cite>Belfast</cite> (Ireland) <cite>Witness</cite>.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The year 1718 marks an epoch in the history of America, because
in that year a band of sturdy Ulster men turned their faces and
fortunes towards the new world. This early and most important
organized company of emigrants to leave Ireland in the eighteenth
century sailed from Lough Foyle in the year above named, and consisted
of about 100 families. (Marmion’s <cite>Maritime Ports of Ireland</cite>.)
These people founded a colony in New Hampshire which
became famous in the history of America. The emigrants were of
as much importance to America as were those of Plymouth, and
from them are descended equally if not more distinguished men.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1727, 3,000 people sailed for the North American colonies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>from Belfast Lough. The following year, ships took 1,000 more,
and in the next three years as many as 4,200. The tidings
of the success of the New Hampshire colonists and of those who
preceded them to other parts of America, drew between the years
1720 and 1742 over 3,000 emigrants annually from Ulster alone.
(Gordon’s <cite>History of Ireland</cite>.) This enormous emigration, for the
period, was stimulated by the rich resources and grand opportunities
offered in a new country on the one hand, and on the other by the
land laws and the restrictions placed on Irish industries.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1736 a number of families emigrated from Banbridge, County
Down, and neighborhood; amongst them were members of the Glass,
MacDowell, Magill, Mulholland, Linn and other families. These
people settled in the Shenandoah Valley on the banks of the Opequan,
Virginia.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the beautiful valley of Shenandoah, three miles south of Winchester,
Va., you will find the ruins of the old Opequan Presbyterian
Church, destroyed in the Civil War. From the Donegal (Pennsylvania)
Presbytery, as early as 1736, the Presbyterian settlers received
attention, as they were visited by missionaries and ministers from
that Presbytery, making it the earliest preaching place in the valley.
The first pastor was John Hodge, who may justly be esteemed the
founder of the church, as he gave five acres of land for the church
site and graveyard. Mr. Hodge, with many of his large family, are
buried there, as well as Samuel Glass, the emigrant from Banbridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Samuel Glass, the leader of the Banbridge emigrants, took up
his residence at the head spring of the Opequan, after many wanderings
through the then almost pathless woods, naming the homestead
Greenwood, from the grand old forest which covered for the most
part the 16,000 acres of land which he had purchased. His son
David settled lower down the river, at a place named Cherry Mead,
and Robert, another son, took up his abode at Long Meadows. James
Vance, a son-in-law of Samuel Glass, resided in the same neighborhood.
Another son-in-law named Becket, lived between the Glass
estate and North Mountain.—(Foot’s <cite>Sketches of Virginia</cite>, second
edition.) Samuel Glass died at an advanced age, honored and respected
by all the settlers over a large portion of the state; he had
centered in his person many good characteristics—courage, thrift,
perseverance. In the cemetery, near the old homestead, stands a
monument to Samuel Glass and his wife, erected by his descendants.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>It is an obelisk, executed in limestone, standing on a pedestal, in all
over ten feet in height. On the south side is inscribed:</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>To the Memory</div>
    <div>of</div>

    <div>Ireland,</div>
    <div><span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 1736.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c007'>Samuel Glass had six children: John, Eliza, Sarah, David, Robert
and Joseph—all born at Banbridge. Joseph Glass, the son of
Samuel Glass, had twelve children: Mary, Samuel, Robert,
Georgetta, Sarah, Elizabeth, Joseph, Martha, Ruth, David, Nancy,
and Sophia. Joseph Glass, son of Joseph, son of Samuel, the emigrant,
entered the ministry of the Presbyterian Church. He was
much esteemed, and widely known as an eloquent preacher. Other
members of the family also distinguished themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Linn, son of one of these settlers, was born at Banbridge
and served under Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virginia, in the wars
with the Indians. In the several encounters which took place he
distinguished himself, and was rewarded with a commission as lieutenant.
Soon after the breaking out of hostilities with the mother
country, Linn joined the First Virginia Regiment with the rank of
lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c007'>An expedition was organized with the object of securing ammunition
from the Spanish authorities at New Orleans. Capt. George Gibson,
an Ulsterman, was entrusted with the leadership of the party,
and attended by Lieutenant Linn, with a detachment of their company,
descended the river Ohio from Fort Pitt on the 19th of May,
1776, reaching New Orleans on the 22d of September, after a succession
of adventures that, in narrative, more resemble romance than
the features of sober truth. The shores of the Ohio were lined with
hostile Indians, and no white man before had attempted the voyage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Captain Gibson having accomplished his mission, and being secretly
released from prison, in which he had been confined to remove the
suspicion of the British residents, placed Lieutenant Linn in command.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Gibson took ship from New Orleans, taking with him the
powder for service on the seaboard, and in due course landed at
Philadelphia, and from thence proceeded to Virginia. Linn’s party,
with a total strength of forty-three men, arrived at Wheeling in the
spring of 1777, with the barges containing the supply of powder for
the western posts. The party suffered many hardships and ran considerable
risk from the Indians. For this important and arduous
service Gibson was raised to the rank of major and Linn to that of
captain. In 1780 we find Linn a colonel commanding a battalion
at the battle of Pigua or Chillicothe, in which action he distinguished
himself with bravery, his battalion having borne the brunt of the
battle, losing many of its men. Colonel Linn continued to serve the
revolted colonies after they had achieved their independence. He
was ordered to the West to assist in the campaign against the Northwest
Indians, and was killed in attempting to reach a secret rendezvous
at a place called No-Linn-Hill, in Kentucky—a name acquired
from the first exclamation of surprise by a party of his men not
finding him at the spot.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='small'>BY HON. JOHN C. LINEHAN,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a> CONCORD, N. H.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. Died in September, 1905. He was a founder of the Society and its first treasurer-general.
This paper was the opening one of a series contributed by him to the Boston
<cite>Pilot</cite>, in 1890, and bearing the general title of “How the Irish Came as Builders of the
Nation.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“The Massachusetts Bay” was, of all the original thirteen colonies,
the most hostile towards the Irish, and it made but little difference
with the Puritans whether the former were Catholic or Presbyterian,
all fared alike, and were looked upon as people neither to be encouraged
nor tolerated.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, they continued to come in, despite this dislike, in one
capacity or another, and one—Captain Patrick—appears in the records
of 1632. Florence McCarthy was a resident of Boston in 1686.
He was a butcher by occupation, and one of the founders of the first
Episcopal Church in the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>Esther MacCarty’s name is signed to an indenture, as a witness,
about the same period. According to Palfrey, New England, up to
the beginning of the great Irish emigration, was more unmixed in
blood than any county in England. While this may seem true of
Massachusetts, it will hardly apply to New Hampshire, and will
not stand investigation in the Bay State, for according to the same
authority, 400 or 500 Scotch were transported by Cromwell to  Massachusetts
in 1651, and thirty-four years later 150 families of French
Huguenots came, followed in 1719, by 120 families of Irish, mainly
from the North of Ireland. To these mentioned by Palfrey must
be added, on the authority of Drake, 200 families of the unfortunate
Acadians sent to Massachusetts about 1750.</p>

<p class='c007'>No mention is made at all of the thousands sold into a kind of
slavery by Cromwell to New England and the West India Islands,
from Ireland, and yet, between 1651 and 1655, on the authority of
Prendergast, over 6,000 boys and girls, mainly from the South of
Ireland, were shipped to those two points.</p>

<p class='c007'>The addition of 400 or 500 Scotch, 150 families of French Huguenots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>and the unknown number of Irish arriving in Massachusetts in
less than twenty-five years from the establishment of the colony of
Massachusetts Bay, will justify a contradiction of this statement of
Palfrey’s. The Acadians and the Irish are prolific, and in this respect
could keep pace with their English neighbors, and a comparison
of the well-known New England families of the past hundred years,
with an equal number of families in any English county, will prove
it, for names, as a rule, are the surest guides to nationalities, and
scattered over New England, from the dates named, are families
bearing well-known French and Gaelic names, many of them slightly
changed, but enough left of the original to trace the transformation.
When the War of the Revolution broke out, this mixture of English,
Irish, Scotch and French blood was pretty well compounded, and it
was not surprising that the men of the new American race humbled
Britain, and brought her to her knees.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adams and Hancock, Sullivan and Knox, Stark and McClary,
Revere and Bowdoin were, in New England, representatives of the
nations mentioned, while the names of Washington and Jefferson,
Moylan and Carroll, Mercer and Paul Jones, Laurens and Marion,
showed that the same process was at work throughout the colonies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many Americans, no matter whence they sprung, now mount the
“Anglo-Saxon” hobby, which, like a circus steed, has been so well
padded by writers of history that there is little danger of a dismount,
and in order to be in harmony with the aristocratic trend of the age,
a double hitch is provided by trotting out the “Scotch-Irish” nag as
a running mate, a trifle bony, perhaps, and a little ungainly at first,
but time, good feeding and careful grooming, will make a perfect
match, for both are of the same stock-humbug—a princely origin, for
in this age humbug is king, and its capital, unlimited, is wind.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Irish blankets and Kilkenny rugs were mercantile commodities
in New Hampshire before King William of “glorious and immortal
memory” had trigged the wheels, Irish butter was a most desirable
article in Boston, as we find that John Hancock, among other
goods advertised in his Faneuil Hall store, speaks of “Newcastle coal
and Irish butter cheap for cash.” Cork from time immemorial being
the great butter mart, it would not be at all surprising if some of the
light-footed and light-hearted sons of that lively city came over with
butter. McCarthy is one of the great Cork names, and in addition
to Florence and Esther, named between 1680 and 1760, Elizabeth,
Thade, William and Calvin Maccarty are met quite frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>in the records of the town of Boston, all persons of means and holding
responsible positions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Florence was town constable in 1693, and Thade Maccarty was
elected to a similar position in 1673. For damage to her house,
blown up to check a fire, Mrs. Elizabeth Maccarty was awarded the
sum of $300 and Maccarty’s corner, on King Street, was a locality
frequently mentioned. Florence was a man of consequence, and one
of the leading men in his business. Leave was given him, in 1693,
to build a slaughter house, and from the frequent mention made of
him he must have been the John P. Squire of his day at the Hub.
William Bryant was a servant of Capt. William Hudson in 1679,
doubtless one of Cromwell’s transports, many of whom were, by that
date, scattered over New England, especially in what is now Maine
and New Hampshire. Larry is quite common along the border,
between the Pine Tree and Granite states, and the first met in history
bear the distinctive given names of Cornelius, Dennis and Teige.
O’Leary is a South of Ireland name, and the presence of persons
bearing it so early in the colonies, substantiates what is stated by
Prendergast in the <cite>Cromwellian Settlement</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eugene Linch (Lynch) came to Boston from Virginia in 1712.
The name of Lynchburgh in the “Old Dominion” denoted the presence
of this good old Galway name. Eugene found a wife in Beverly;
and although bearing an aristocratic Norman name, he was not
good enough to reside in Boston, being ordered to go to Beverly and
stay with his wife. James Bettrell, “an Irish shoemaker,” had better
luck, however, being allowed to remain, on giving bonds. James
Barry was a noted huntsman in 1702, and was complained of for
allowing his dogs to run loose. The town constable ordered him to
shut them up.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is quite frequent mention of ships loaded with passengers
from Ireland, bound for Pennsylvania or Virginia, putting into Boston,
from stress of weather, want of provisions, or sickness among the
people on board. Care was taken by the town authorities to prevent
the landing of any of the passengers, and the records are full of such
instances, between 1700 and 1800, and the town constables were at
their wits’ ends to keep the unwelcome visitors out, for those who
landed in other parts of the country came by land to Boston,
attracted, no doubt, by the rising trade and manufactures of the
future metropolis of New England. Of this class, undoubtedly, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Charles Conner, his wife and child, who came from Philadelphia in
1732, only to be ordered out of town at once—a fate many of his
nationality had to suffer during this epoch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Drake, in his <cite>Landmarks of Boston</cite>, says: “About 1718 a number
of colonists arrived from Londonderry, bringing with them the manufacture
of linen and the implements used in Ireland. These emigrants
also introduced the general use of their favorite vegetable, the
potato.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They were not met with a warm welcome, however. So many
were coming from Ireland, in 1718, that Dea. John Marian was
ordered to appear before the courts and take such steps as he might
deem proper to keep them away from the town of Boston, and in this
respect the authorities were impartial. No distinction was made
between the natives of Cork or Belfast, Londonderry or Limerick,
the followers of the old faith or the new; all were treated alike; it
was enough to know that they were Irish. But despite all the obstacles
thrown in their way, they kept coming, and so fast that finally
the town council resolved that some steps must be taken to register
them, so in case any of them became a town charge, their nationality
might be known.</p>

<p class='c007'>To that end all persons receiving or entertaining any of the Irish
people were ordered to notify the authorities, on penalty of being
fined twenty shillings for the first forty-eight hours and ten shillings
for every twenty-four hours afterwards. Repeated warnings
were given, but were as often disregarded. January, 1719, John
Maccanis, wife and four children, were ordered to leave (John
McGuinnis would be nearer the mark). Two shiploads, under command
of Capt. Robert Holmes and a Captain Dennis, were refused
permission to land, the same year. In September, 1744, three Irish
boys and sixteen Irish girls were captured by a French privateer and
forwarded from Capt. Breton to Boston. Among them were James
Connor, Thomas Bryan, Charles White, Mary Roberts, Mary Price,
Sarah Agin, Mary Benson, Margaret Anderson, Sarah Hathay, Elizabeth
Campbell, Mary Hammell, Eliza Fitzgerald, Sarah McMahon,
Bridget McNamara, Eliza Dunster, Fanny Brady, Jenny Richardson,
Kathleen Morris, Mary Derham. No doubt these poor waifs were
looked after by the Charitable Irish Society, which was then instituted
about seven years. The feeling against their nationality was
gradually wearing away, and the settlements of their countrymen in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>New Hampshire were already furnishing the best fighting men
against the French and Indians.</p>

<p class='c007'>As early as 1758, the Macs, with many other well-known Irish
names, were taking a prominent place in the town records. McCarthy,
McCarroll, McClane, MacCluer, McConnell, McCown, McCullum,
McDaniel, McDonnell, McDonald, McElroy, McFadden,
McFarland, McGowan, McIntire, McKeen, McKey, McKnight,
McKenzie, McLean, McNeal, McPherson, McQuestion, Mooney,
Montgomery, Moore, Murphy, Ryan, Powers, Welch, etc., were
entered side by side with their English neighbors, so that there is
no question that Boston had within its borders when the Revolution
broke out, a large share of that stock,—the Irish—which made
its influence felt during the struggle, and which furnished in the
massacre one of the first victims, in the person of Patrick Carr.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides Boston, there were few towns in New England where an
Irishman could not be found between 1700 and 1800. In the contingent
from Ipswich, Mass., in 1755, at Lake George, were John
Fitzpatrick, William Connolly and Thomas Looney, and in the
records of deaths in the town’s history is that of James Fitzgerald,
who died in 1727. Americans bearing these names, some of them
changed slightly, are found all over the country—Fitzes and Geralds,
Patricks, and Connollys, the latter changed to Colony and Collony.
The modern Fitzes discard any but a Norman origin, however,
and the Patricks are, of course, “Scotch-Irish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jeremiah Smith, born in Ireland in 1705, came to Massachusetts
in 1726, locating at Milton. He was accompanied by his wife. He
was the first to raise potatoes in the town, and the first to manufacture
paper in the colony, and perhaps in the country. A neighbor of
his, a Mr. Babcock, having raised two bushels of potatoes from seed
given him by Mr. Smith, came to the latter and told him he did not
know what on earth to do with so many. Mr. Smith told him not to
fret, he would buy them of him. Babcock said he did not know what
to do with his Irish help; they did not understand raising American
vegetables; he sent one of them out to get some green corn for dinner
the other day, and he came back without any, saying that “he
had dug up five or six hills, and the divil a kernel of corn could he
find.” Smith told him that the Irish knew as much about raising
corn as the Americans did about raising potatoes, and knew less how
to use them. Smith was a member of the Presbyterian Church in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Boston. He bears honorable mention in the town history, and was
respected by all his fellow-townsmen. He died in 1790.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Sullivan was also interested in the manufacture of paper, in
that section, between 1780 and 1790, and associated with him in the
business were Patrick Connor and Michael McCarney. Others of
Irish birth in the town at the same time, who were prominent in
its affairs, were Peter O’Kelly, Hugh McLean, Peter McElroy and
James McClary. That was quite a group of Irishmen in a suburb
of Boston, and there was no question but that they were men of enterprise
and push. O’Kelly, with his wife and six children, went to
South Carolina in 1796. McCarney was one of a corporation, organized
in 1798, the Mill Creek and Neponset River Company, for the
manufacture of paper. Their mills were situated near where the
chocolate manufactory of Walter Baker was afterwards located.
McCleary’s name appears on the rolls of the Charitable Irish Society
in 1789. This is one of the names noted in New Hampshire’s military
and civil history. Maj. Andrew McClary, of Stark’s regiment,
was killed at Bunker Hill. He was one of the finest looking, as he
was one of the bravest, men in the army, and his death was then
looked upon as a great loss to the cause of Independence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among those who went with a colony from the Massachusetts Bay
to Delaware, in 1644, were John Nolin and his wife. The Swedes,
who were already located there, looked upon the newcomers as interlopers,
and made it very unpleasant for them. The result was the
appointment of a commission to investigate the alleged outrage on
the Massachusetts men. John Nolin was one of the principal witnesses,
the Swedish governor having placed him in irons. Nolan
was undoubtedly the correct way of spelling the name, and it would
not be at all surprising if, like Darby Field of New Hampshire, he
was one of the “Irish soldiers for discovery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>John Patrick of Barre, Mass., was a lieutenant in the company
recruited in that town, at the outbreak of the Revolution. His
father was an emigrant from Ireland, and the original name was
Kilpatrick. His descendants are scattered through New England,
and like all sprung from Gaelic stock, have been prolific. He died
in 1807, aged sixty-eight. Gen. M. R. Patrick, provost marshal of
the Army of the Potomac, and at his death superintendent of the
Soldiers’ Home at Dayton, Ohio, was one of his descendants. In
harmony with the usage of the day, the descendants of the lieutenant
derive a “Scotch-Irish” ancestry for the founder of the family.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Among the births recorded in Boston in the returns of births and
baptisms, from 1630 to 1699, are Francis, son of Thaddeus and
Eliza MacCarty, February 19, 1666; Thaddeus, son of the same parents,
in September, 1670; Margaret, born February 25, 1676; Catherine,
born January 23, 1679, of the same parents; Elizabeth, daughter
of Florence and Elizabeth MacCarty, born December 25, 1687;
Thomas, son of the same, born February 5, 1688 (evidently a mistake
in dates); William, son of the same, born February 3, 1690.
Mrs. Eliza MacCarty died July 6, 1696. Florence waited a little
over a year before taking another partner, but not thinking it best to
live alone, he married Sarah Newwork on August 24, 1697. She
presented him with another Sarah in 1698.</p>

<p class='c007'>The William MacCarty mentioned, became a noted shipmaster, and
had the reputation of being a fine navigator. He was an enterprising
man, fully up to the standard reached by his father and
grandfather. The son, Rev. Thaddeus MacCarty, born in 1721, was
a graduate of Harvard College and a minister in the Congregational
Church. He was called to the pastorate of the first parish in
Worcester, in 1746, where he remained thirty-seven years. He married
a Welsh girl, and by her had fifteen children. He is described
as being tall and slender, with dark eyes, sonorous voice and very
pleasing address. He was a prolific writer, and like James Sullivan
of another Munster family, one of the most scholarly men of his
day; he died in 1784. His son, Thaddeus, born in 1747, was a
noted medical practitioner. He first located in Dudley, then
changed to Fitchburg, Mass., where he established a hospital for the
treatment of smallpox by the Suttonian method. Here at one time
he had 800 patients. He afterwards removed to Keene, N. H.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another son, William MacCarty, was quartermaster of Colonel
Bigelow’s Fifteenth Massachusetts Regiment in the Revolutionary
War. Thus, in Massachusetts, three of the best known South of Ireland
families, O’Brien (in Maine), MacCarty and Sullivan, were
represented before and during the Revolution; and it is pleasant to
record that all were true to the cause of Independence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mackues had a representative in Timothy, son of Timothy
and Ann Mackue, born October 20, 1699, probably one of the
McCues or McHughes, all the same. Sarah, daughter of William
and Olive McLoughlin, was born on October 29, 1689; and Eliza
followed on September 10, 1691, who was joined by Mary, born on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>March 22, 1694. These undoubtedly are the ancestors of many
McGloughlins, McLathlans, or Lafflins, as the fancy seized their
descendants to alter the spelling, just as the name McCarthy became
in time Maccarty, Maccartie, MacCarter, Carter or Carte, varied occasionally
by Carty. On February 14, 1658, not a great many
years after the founding of the colony, “James Webster a Scotishman
&amp; Mary Hay an Irish maid were married.” Mary was, no
doubt, one of the poor girls torn from her home in Ireland, but hard
as her lot was, she was fortunate in not being sent to the West
Indies; but would it not be of interest to find, at the present time,
the descendants of the Scotch laddie and the Irish lassie, the Websters
of 1658?</p>

<p class='c007'>Another couple, married April 5, 1692, bear names that denote
Irish blood—Andrew Rankins and Grace Butler. The ceremony
was performed by Gov. Simon Bradstreet. Daniel, son of Dermin—probably
Dermot—Mahoone, was born Oct. 4, 1646. The
next child born to the couple, on August 29, 1648, bore the well-known
Irish name of Honour, and the name itself must have been
Mahon, or Mahoney. Mrs. Mahone died November 8, 1656, and
her husband, like his countryman, McCarty, did not remain single
long, as another child, Margaret, was presented him on June 3,
1661, but it was after his death, which took place on April 2, 1661.
His widow, Margaret, did not long grieve for him, for in the following
July, 1661, the record reads, “Bryan Morfrey (Murphy) an
Irishman &amp; Margaret Mayhoone widow were married 20th July by
John Endecott Governor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Murphys were on hand “airly,” and no doubt made their
mark, but where are their descendants? Hannah, daughter of John
and Ann Cogan, was born September 6, 1636. This may be one of
the characteristic names of England, but is more common in Ireland,
being carried there by Milo De Cogan, one of Strongbow’s Norman
knights. John was born to Garrett and Mary Bourne, May 30,
1643. Both given and proper names have an Irish appearance.
The first Kelly having the honor of being entered on the records of
births was Daniel, son of David and Elizabeth Kelly, born December
18, 1647; like the Murphys, they were on hand early; and also
like the Murphys, are of the undiluted old stock, Gaelic to the core.
Today, on account of the prominence of the name, it is as American
as it is Irish, and what is still better, the spelling remains the same
in both countries.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>The first Butler, who heads the roll of a long line of descendants,
and a representative of one of the most illustrious names on two continents,
makes his bow in August, 1653, in the person of Benjamin,
son of Stephen and Jane Butler. November, 1656, “Edmond Coussins
of Pulling Point and Margaret Bird an Irish maid servant to
John Grover of Rumney Marsh were married.” An Irish linnet
to a French Huguenot, probably. Mary and John Bohanno,
another Scotch laddie, and an Irish lass, were blessed with a little
Mary on May 9, 1658. From these records it can be safely inferred
that the exiles from Scotland and Ireland, the victims of Cromwell’s
tyranny, were, in their persons, uniting the two branches of the old
Gaelic race, as frequent mention is made of marriages between
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bohanno was undoubtedly Bohan or Buchanan, both from the
same root. John Morrell, an Irishman, and Lysbell Morrell, an
Irishwoman, were married, August 31, 1659. March 15, 1661,
John Reylean, an Irishman, and Margaret Brene, an Irishwoman,
were married by John Endicott, Governor. John, son of John
and Sarah Starkey, was born on September 23, 1666, abbreviated
later on to Stark. Barry appears on the roll, January 8, 1688.
James, son of James, being born on that date. Kenney does not
appear until 1691, when, on February 13, Moses and Margaret
Kenny were blessed with the gift of a daughter. Like Butler and
Kelly, this is not one of the most common names in America, as it is
in Ireland—McKenna, Kenna, Kenny. Mulligan turns up in 1681,
in the person of Robert, son of Hugh and Eleanor Mulligan, born
on August 9. The Millikens and Mullikens can trace the stream
and find the source, perhaps, here. Morrissey (spelled Morris and
Morrisse) appears in 1655.</p>

<p class='c007'>Edward Morris and Dermon (Dermot) and Honora Morrisse are
mentioned quite often—some of the transports, undoubtedly.
Another of the exiles, or the child of one, was Johanna Heffernan
who married Christopher Vale in 1692. Mary Lynch married James
Townsend in 1693, and Henry Townsen wedded Mary Keefe the
same year—two more “Scotch-Irish” unions if names are an index to
nationality—and still another at the same time was that of Mary
Peard to Samuel Swetman.</p>

<p class='c007'>The good old name of Hayes, in the persons of Thomas and his
wife, Bridget, shows up July 25, 1690, when unto them a child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>was born, named Eliza. This is like some other names mentioned,
found now all over the country; in this case, Bridget must be the
Eve of the modern Garden of Eden—the Hub—at least so far as the
Hayes’ are concerned, for she was the first of the tribe in the Trimountain
Paradise. Reilly has two representatives in John and
Bridget Rylee, who had born to them on September 10, 1693, a
daughter, Hannah. After 1700, Irish names peculiar to the South,
as well as the North of Ireland, rapidly appear. In the records of
the selectmen of the town of Boston, September 27, 1736, John
Savell was required to give a bond for a servant imported from Ireland
by Captain Arnold. James Wimble had to do the same for
George Lucas’ wife and child from Ireland.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain John Carrell—Carroll—ditto, for twelve persons he
brought from Ireland in his vessel. Dinish and Honor Cniae—Kenna—and
their two boys, were of this number. September 29,
Joshua Winslow, Esq., gave a bond for William Steward, wife and
two children, imported by Captain Boyd. Steward was a cooper,
and in the following November was admitted an inhabitant of the
town.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='small'>BY HERBERT N. CASSON, NEW YORK CITY.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. Published originally in <cite>Munsey’s Magazine</cite>, New York, April, 1906.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A certain green isle in a northerly sea is the historic home of the
Irish people, but the present address of at least two thirds of the
scattered race is “United States of America.” Boston, not Belfast
nor Dublin, is now the greatest Irish city in the world; and the
overwhelming majority of Irishmen who have risen to places of distinction
have done so under the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The historian who shall do full justice to the Irish branch of the
human family has not yet appeared, either in the United States or
elsewhere. Consequently, there are few races, if any, which have
been so persistently misunderstood and undervalued. Even in this
country, where such a mistake is least excusable, there has been a
tendency in some quarters to regard the Irish as merely an element
of the rank and file. The truth is that they have contributed their
share of leaders and pioneers in almost every line of progress.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>At least seven of our presidents</em> have had more or less of Irish
blood in their veins. Jackson, Buchanan and Arthur were the sons
of Ulster parents; and the first American ancestor of Polk was an
Irish immigrant. Monroe and McKinley were more remotely
related to the “fighting race.” The latter, it is well known, was
fond of saying, “We Irish.” Roosevelt, also, had several Hibernian
twigs on his family tree. This, in itself, is an amazing record of
Celtic leadership—to have helped to mold the character of seven
American presidents out of twenty-five.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the making of America, the Irish have been structural. No
other word represents their influence so well. In the clearing of forests,
the digging of canals, the building of railroads, and the extension
of commerce, our civilization owes an incalculable debt to Irish
hands and Irish heads.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the traits of our national character, too, we Americans are all
more Irish than we realize. Our versatility and buoyancy, our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>quickness of initiative, our free and unconventional ways, and the
sporting instinct that leads us to take chances and beat records, are
a few of the evidences of an Irish strain in our blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the handiwork of the Irish were painted green, the average
American city would be splashed on all sides with emerald hues.
Yet there are few who are aware of this, even among the Irish themselves.
A New Yorker, for example, may rise in the morning, bathe
in water that comes from the Croton dam, built by James Coleman,
ex-president of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick; breakfast on
Cudahy bacon; then take the subway, built by John B. McDonald,
past the new College of the City of New York, built by Thomas
Dwyer, to his office in a skyscraper built by John D. Crimmins,
where he will cable to Alaska over a line laid by David Lynch, to
order certain freight sent <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">via</span></i> James J. Hill’s Great Northern Railroad.
Then, with a cigar bought from one of George J. Whelan’s
300 cigar stores, he will read the New York <cite>Sun</cite>, published by William
M. Laffan and delivered by the American News Company,
founded by Patrick Farrelly—and remark to an English friend:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, of course, this is an Anglo-Saxon country.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When J. I. C. Clarke, the genial playwright, wrote his famous
poem on “Kelly and Burke and Shea,” it was generally supposed to
be a poetic fancy. On the contrary, I find it to be a simple matter
of American history that the Kellys, the Burkes and the Sheas have
been to the fore in every generation. They were all three in the
battle of Lexington, as well as in the death-list of the <em>Maine</em>. When
Hobson sank the <em>Merrimac</em>, a Kelly and a Murphy were his comrades
in danger. Our first noted woman abolitionist was Abbie Kelley.
William Darrah Kelley, of Philadelphia, was a Congressman
for nearly thirty years. Hall Jackson Kelley was the founder of
Oregon. The late Eugene Kelly, the New York banker, won renown
as a philanthropist. Among the living members of this
redoubtable family, James E. Kelly is a well-known electrical engineer.
The Kelly Ax Company has a fifty-acre plant in Charleston,
W. Va. Elsewhere&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* you will find the wonderful story
of William Kelly, whose invention has added hundreds of millions
to the wealth of the steel industry.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Burke family, three heroic figures appear in the first chapter
of our Revolutionary history—Thomas Burke, the first governor
of North Carolina; Adamus Burke, chancellor of South Carolina;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>and John Daly Burk, historian, patriot and duelist. All three were
fighters with pen and sword, who made an indelible mark on the
Southern states a century ago. In 1872, when Froude cast some
aspersions upon the Irish, it was Father Thomas Burke who took up
the cudgels against him. And at the present time we have Burkes
enough in the United States to fill a “Burke’s Peerage” of their own.
There are two bishops who bear the famous name, at Albany and
St. Joseph; one brigadier-general, at Portland, Oregon; one congressman,
in South Dakota; a railroad president, at Cleveland; and
a judge at Seattle.</p>

<p class='c007'>As for the Sheas, at least four of them have buffeted their way to
the front—Gen. John Shea,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a> who won his laurels in the Revolution;
Capt. Daniel Shays, who first fought at Bunker Hill and
then stirred up a little side-show rebellion on his own account;
George A. Shea, an eminent chief justice of New York; and John
Gilmary Shea, the historian of the Catholic Church in the United
States.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. Gen. John Shee.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the American business world of today, a large proportion of
the solid men—the men who stand like pillars under the heavy burdens—are
of Irish blood. Most conspicuous of all stands the financier
upon whom the mantle of J. Pierpont Morgan seems to have
fallen—the man who is not only combining but coördinating American
capital—Thomas Fortune Ryan. He is one of the greatest
masters of financial statesmanship, who cuts the Gordian knots of
finance and ties others of his own.</p>

<p class='c007'>Equally immovable, in a different field, stands James J. Hill, born
in Canada of Ulster parents. What this one man has done for the
United States has never yet been fully told. He is the creator of
the Northwest—the railway builder who has opened up a territory
equal to a couple of Germanys—the steamship builder who has
linked America with the markets of the East. He has made wide
pathways of commerce from Lake Superior across 1,500 miles of
wilderness and 5,000 miles of ocean to the ports of China, Russia
and Japan. Ever since he double-earned his first dollar as a Mississippi
roustabout, fifty years ago, his life has been a continuous obstacle-race;
and there have been few occasions when James J. Hill
missed a hurdle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two other railway presidents are Samuel Sloan, of New York,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>who was born when Madison was in the White House; and Richard
C. Kerens, of St. Louis. Daniel O’Day<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a>—every inch of him Irish—is
one of the most important members of the imperial group of financiers
who float the flag of Standard Oil. Forty years since, he was
a laborer in the oil regions, whose main problem was to find a job;
today, as he jokingly says to his friends, his main problem is to find
out how to invest his surplus. Another New Yorker of Titanic
mold is Alexander E. Orr, who was nineteen years old before he had
seen any other country than Ireland. As a president of large commercial
bodies, he has few equals. He is a director who directs.
For nearly fifty years he has stood under the heaviest responsibilities,
and was recently chosen, because of his ability and uprightness, to
preside over the immense interests of the New York Life Insurance
Company.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. Recently deceased.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If we speak of great Irish bankers, where is there a large American
city without one? In Pittsburg, for instance, where there are a
score of banks bulging with steel millions, the dean of the financial
fraternity is Thomas Mellon, who, like Alexander E. Orr, was born
in Tyrone. In New York there are three, at least, who are too prominent
to miss—Thomas M. Mulry, the new president of the Emigrant
Industrial Savings Bank, which was wholly Irish in its origin, and
which holds a hundred millions in its vaults; Miles M. O’Brien, who
was for some time the president of the board of education; and Samuel
G. Bayne, who is notable for having organized national banks in
seven states. Charles J. Bell is a conspicuous figure in the national
capital, as John C. Davis is in Wyoming. And in Chicago John R.
Walsh has been a notable banker and capitalist for twenty years.
The recent collapse of his financial structure should not obscure the
facts of his extraordinary career. To begin as a barefooted newsboy,
and to struggle to a place of power in the sixth greatest city in
the world, always preferring to fight big enemies rather than little
ones—that was Walsh’s record.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the cattle kings of the West are Timothy Kinney, of
Wyoming, and George Russell, of Nevada. Also in Chicago, Milwaukee
and Omaha are four brothers who know something about the
cattle and beef trade—four brothers whose parents left Kilkenny in
the forties because black famine threatened them with starvation;
who began their business life with no more chance of fortune than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>any day laborer in the United States, and who are today numbered
among the few masters of the food supply of the world—Michael,
Edward A., John and Patrick Cudahy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other weighty business men, scattered here and there, are John
Flannery, the Savannah cotton king; Thomas F. Walsh, of Washington,
who is the president of the Irrigation Congress; John D.
Crimmins, the contractor who has added 400 buildings to New York;
Patrick F. Murphy, president of the Mark Cross Company and well
known in New York as an after-dinner speaker; Edward Malley,
who began with a pack on his back and has now a department store
in New Haven; Ephraim Dempsie, merchant and public man of
Spokane; P. B. Magrane, a well-known merchant in the shoe city
of Lynn; and William P. Rend, the coal magnate of Chicago.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the great Irish merchants of former days, the most notable
was A. T. Stewart, whose New York store was the largest of its
kind, either in America or elsewhere. His capital was $3,000 when
he began to sell his Belfast laces, and more than forty millions when
he died.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the United States, as well as in Great Britain, many of the
most distinguished judges have been of Irish blood. Among the
nine justices who sit supreme over all American courts, two are Irish
by descent—Judge Edward D. White and Judge Joseph McKenna.
As yet, no one has compiled a list of the Irish judges in the various
state Supreme Courts; but to take New York as an instance, we find
five who are of unusual prominence—Martin J. Keogh, Morgan J.
O’Brien, James Fitzgerald, George C. Barrett and Victor J. Dowling.
It should also be mentioned that the chief judge in the Philippine
Islands—John T. McDonough, formerly of Albany—is Irish
born. William J. Hynes, too, a lawyer of whom Chicago is justly
proud, began life in County Clare.</p>

<p class='c007'>To answer fully the question “What have the Irish done for American
education?” would need a small book in itself. Was not the
late Pres. William Rainey Harper, the father of Chicago University,
of Irish descent? This extraordinary man crowded the
work of several centuries into less than fifty years, sacrificed his
preferences as a student that he might carry the heaviest financial
responsibilities, and died poor after having gathered a dozen millions
for his university.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of our Irish born educators, no one outranks William H. Maxwell,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>who has been for eight years the superintendent of New York’s public
schools. Under him are 16,000 teachers and more than half a
million children, the most lively and cosmopolitan army of youngsters
in the world. Superintendent Maxwell has had to fight for
every inch of progress in his development of the New York school
system; but like the dogged Ulsterman that he is, he has driven
ahead with his far-reaching projects, no matter whether the hue and
cry was with him or against him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing is too good,” he says, “for the taxpayer’s child.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Speaking of public schools, it would be a sin of omission at this
point not to mention the thousands of young women of Irish birth or
parentage who are doing faithful work as schoolteachers in all parts
of the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of our Irish professors is comparatively small. Some
who deserve special mention are Maurice F. Egan, of the Catholic
University in Washington; James McMahon, of Cornell; Robert
Ellis Thompson, of the Central High School in Philadelphia; and
Thomas C. Hall, of the Union Theological Seminary in New York.
A Gaelic chair was established in 1896 at the Catholic University
by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and is filled at the present time
by Prof. Joseph P. Dunn, who is of American birth. To John
Tyndall, the notable Irish scientist, the United States owes a double
debt, inasmuch as he not only delivered a course of lectures here in
1872, but devoted the proceeds to the cause of scientific research in
America.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is very seldom that an Irishman lacks the gift of speech. Take
away our Irish orators and journalists, and this would be a dumb
and cheerless country indeed. Here, for instance, is an offhand list
of Irish writers of the past and present:</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. Mayne Reid, the idol of American boys, and a soldier in
our War with Mexico; John Boyle O’Reilly, the editor and poet;
FitzJames O’Brien, who wrote the famous short story, “The Diamond
Lens”; Ignatius Donnelly, the most versatile and picturesque
public man of his generation in Minnesota; Edwin Lawrence Godkin,
of the New York <cite>Evening Post</cite>, a fighter in the high realm of
national morality; Henry W. Grady, editor of the Atlanta <cite>Constitution</cite>;
Patrick Walsh, who was editor of the Augusta <cite>Chronicle</cite> and
represented Georgia in the United States Senate; and Joseph Medill,
founder of the Chicago <cite>Tribune</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Among those still living are James Jeffrey Roche, now in the
consular service; Joseph Fitzgerald, author and translator; William
M. Laffan, proprietor of the New York <cite>Sun</cite>; George T. Oliver, of
the Pittsburg <cite>Gazette</cite>; Eugene M. O’Neill, of the Pittsburg <cite>Dispatch</cite>;
John McLeod Keating, who won fame by his fight against
yellow fever in the South; and John F. Finerty, the eloquent founder
of the Chicago <cite>Citizen</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three great publishers of Irish birth have been Mathew Carey,
of Philadelphia, the friend of Lafayette; Robert Bonner, founder of
the New York <cite>Ledger</cite>; and Patrick Donahoe, founder of the Boston
<cite>Pilot</cite> and <cite>Donahoe’s Magazine</cite>. The name of William Desmond
O’Brien, too, deserves to be included in this paragraph. Mr.
O’Brien was a wealthy contractor of New York who devoted eighteen
years of his life to the preparation of an <cite>Encyclopedia Hibernica</cite>,
and who died, broken-hearted, in 1893, with his great project unfinished.
Among Irish-American publishers now living, the most notable
is P. F. Collier, founder of <cite>Collier’s Weekly</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>This power of expression, which is typical of the Irish race, rises
frequently to the heights of art. The Goddess of Liberty, on the
dome of the Capitol at Washington, was chiseled by the hands of
Thomas Crawford, who was of Irish parentage, and whose son is
the well-known novelist, F. Marion Crawford. Many an American
city has been enriched by the genius of Augustus St. Gaudens, one
of the best beloved and most eminent of American sculptors. The
statue upon which St. Gaudens is now working, in his Vermont
studio, is a heroic figure of Parnell for the City of Dublin, St. Gaudens’
birthplace. Among the landscape painters, Edward Gay, of
New York, has held a place for forty years; and another veteran
artist of Irish birth is William Magrath, who painted “On the Ould
Sod”—a clever study of Irish character that hangs in the Metropolitan
Museum in New York.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to Dublin, also, that we are indebted for Victor Herbert,
our popular conductor and composer, and for Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore,
the famous band master of Civil War times. There have not
been so many Irish singers of operatic rank, although the Irishman
who cannot sing at all is as rare as a white blackbird. Probably the
most notable was Catherine Hayes, who arrived in this country in
1851, married an American husband and settled in California.
Among the best-known dramatic stars of Irish birth now upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>stage are Ada Rehan and James O’Neil, and the elder John Drew
was a son of Erin. Andrew Mack and Chauncey Olcott are the
most popular of those who portray Irish life.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the Irish have been in politics goes without saying. In most
states they have furnished more than their share, both of bosses and
of reformers. Richard Croker, the Tammany Hall leader, and
Charles O’Conor, who overthrew the Tweed Ring, fairly represent
the two contending forces in American political life. So much has
been written indiscriminately of Irish bossism that it is nothing but
fair to state that some of the present leaders of the “anti-graft”
movement are Mayor Dunne, of Chicago; Mayor Fagan, of Jersey
City; District Attorney Moran, of Boston; and Hugh McCaffrey, a
member of Mayor Weaver’s cabinet, in Philadelphia. The late Patrick
A. Collins, congressman, consul-general in London and mayor
of Boston, was for years the foremost Irishman in New England.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present Congress there are dozens of members of Irish
descent, but only three of Irish birth—Senator Thomas M. Patterson,
of Denver, who has been for thirty years a national figure; Representative
Bourke Cockran, who is unequaled in the Celtic flow of his
eloquence; and Delegate Bernard S. Rodney, of New Mexico. Senator
Thomas Kearns, one of the solid pillars of the state of Utah,
was born in Canada of Irish parents; and James D. Phelan, the well-known
Californian, was the son of a wealthy Irish merchant of San
Francisco. Three other public men of Irish birth are Thomas Taggart,
of Indianapolis; William McAdoo, of New York; and ex-Governor
James E. Boyd, of Nebraska. And no Irishman will ever
allow the fact to be forgotten that James G. Blaine, one of the
greatest figures in all American political history, was of Irish descent.
His great-grandfather, Ephraim Blaine, bore an honorable part in
the Revolutionary struggle, and far back in colonial days the Blaines
were among the hardiest pioneers of the Cumberland Valley.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rising to the religious world, we find many noted Irish names,
alike in the Protestant and Catholic churches. There are no fewer
than twenty-three bishops and five archbishops in this country who
learned their first prayers on Irish soil. This may also be said of
Cardinal Gibbons, who was born in the United States, but taken to
Ireland in infancy. The five archbishops are John M. Farley, John
J. Glennon, John Ireland, John Joseph Keane, and Patrick John
Ryan. When was there ever before such a distinguished quintet of
Johns?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Like St. Gaudens and Herbert, Dr. William S. Rainsford hails
from Dublin. Thirty years ago he entered New York an unknown
young curate, and proceeded to establish the foremost institutional
church in America, having at the present time more than 5,000 members.
Unfortunately, overwork has recently compelled him to resign.</p>

<p class='c007'>Historically, there have been four Irish churchmen who have
wielded a great influence in American affairs—Father Mathew, the
apostle of temperance, who persuaded 600,000 Americans to sign
the pledge; Archbishop Hughes, of New York, who was sent to
England by President Lincoln during the Civil War; Father Ryan,
the poet of the South; and the Rev. John Hall, the pulpit orator of
New York.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing can be more absurd than to speak of the Irish as newcomers
in America. No one but a resurrected mound-builder would
be entitled to do that. For the last thousand years or more, wherever
there has been any great enterprise on foot, in the thick of things
there have always been men with the shamrock in their hearts. The
ship that carried Columbus from the known continent to the unknown
had a Galway man aboard—so we are told on good authority.
And one of the maps which cheered Columbus forward showed
a country across the ocean which was called “Great Ireland.”
This far western land had been discovered, it was reported, by St.
Brendan, an Irish monk, eight or nine centuries before.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were a few Irish on the <em>Mayflower</em>, but the first large body
arrived about twenty years later. There were five or six hundred of
them—a forlorn and pitiful mob, forcibly transported from their
native land. Those were the black days of Cromwell, when $25
was paid for the head of a wolf and $50 for the head of a patriot
Irishman. In ten years probably 100,000 were driven out, and many
of them came to the American colonies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first big Irishman in our colonial history was Gov. Thomas
Dongan, who gave New York its earliest charter, and who deserves
to be called one of the pioneer champions of popular rights in
America. The second was the distinguished philosopher, Bishop
Berkeley, who came from Derry to Rhode Island in 1728, lured by a
missionary enterprise that failed. All through the eighteenth century
came a steady stream of the exiled Irish—men and women who
had been toughened in a terrible school, and who were fit and ready
for the perils of the American wilderness. Most of them were from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the north of Ireland—from little Ulster, that giant-breeding province
whose sons have made history in almost every country of the earth.
They were the first across the Alleghanies. They settled Tennessee,
Kentucky, West Virginia and the coal and iron regions of Pennsylvania.
Such men as Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett and Matthew
Lyon were their leaders. It was they who colonized Ulster County
in New York and Londonderry in New Hampshire. The colonial
hero of the Catskills was Timothy Murphy—so wrote Jay Gould in
his famous <cite>History of Delaware County</cite>, published fifty years ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the War of Independence began there were Irish on the
firing-line everywhere. They had a personal as well as a colonial
grievance against Great Britain; and here was a chance, at last, to
even up old scores. A writer of those times describes them as “a
hardy, brave, hot-headed race; excitable in temper; unrestrainable
in passion; invincible in prejudice. They are impatient of restraint,
and rebellious against anything that in their eyes bears the resemblance
of injustice. They were the readiest of the ready on the battlefields
of the Revolution.” These were not parlor virtues, but they
were the kind that founded the American republic. “You lost
America by the Irish,” declared Lord Mountjoy in the British Parliament.</p>

<p class='c007'>In those critical days, while thousands were dilly-dallying, the
Irish were hot for action. It was John Sullivan who struck the first
blow, four months before the historic skirmish at Lexington, by capturing
military stores at Portsmouth. The Sullivan family, of which
he was a member, furnished three governors for the young republic.
Their mother, in her old age, used to say that she had often worked
in the fields carrying the governor of Massachusetts, while the governors
of New Hampshire and Vermont tagged at her skirts. The
first British warship was captured by an O’Brien; and John Barry
became the official father of the American navy by receiving the earliest
commission as captain. The first American general to fall was
the brilliant Richard Montgomery, whose virtues compelled even
Lord North to lament his death. It is an interesting fact, and one
of which few are aware, that the three monuments in front of New
York’s oldest church—St. Paul’s, on lower Broadway, are in memory
of three famous Irishmen—General Montgomery, Thomas Addis
Emmet and Dr. William MacNevin, the first scientific chemist of
New York.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>In 1776 three of the signers were of Irish birth—Matthew Thornton,
James Smith and George Taylor. Five others, at least, were of
Irish blood—Edward Rutledge, Thomas Lynch, Thomas McKean,
George Reed and Charles Carroll of Carrollton. The secretary of
the assemblage, who read aloud the Declaration on the birth-morning
of our republic, was Charles Thompson, Irish born and the son of an
evicted farmer. And one of the first societies to back George Washington
with men and money was the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of
Philadelphia, who raised half a million dollars and swung into line
with a cheer. Only one of their members objected, and his name
was struck from the society’s rolls. Washington was a frequent
guest at their banquets and an honorary member, as President Roosevelt
is of the same society in New York.</p>

<p class='c007'>No history of the Revolution is complete without its Irish chapter.
What with the dashing work of the Irish Brigade under Count Dillon;
with the exploits of Mad Anthony Wayne and General Moylan,
the Murat of the Revolutionary cavalry; and with the powerful aid
of Burke and Sheridan in England, King George the Third found
himself beset by Irishmen from all quarters. There were whole
companies of Irishmen who fought for American independence under
their own green flag, as loyal to their adopted country as to the land
of their birth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most typical Irishman of pioneer times was Andrew Jackson,
our seventh president. One secret of his greatness lay in the fact
that there were many men of his mold and nationality in every American
community. It is a fact that should cause every Irish heart to
beat with pride that the first American president who rose from the
rank and file, without the prestige of aristocratic birth or the polish
of education, was the son of a rack-rented exile from Ulster. It may
even be true that he was the first in the world’s history to climb so
high, not by force of arms, but by the free choice of a free people.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Old Hickory,” as his soldiers called him, has had no superiors
as a popular leader. None of his enemies, and he made many of
them, could question his honesty, his sincerity, his courage. He
believed that the duty of a government was to protect the weak, curb
the strong, and obey public opinion. During his presidency the
United States bounded into industrial greatness and international
prestige.</p>

<p class='c007'>Overlapping Jackson came another typical Irishman, equally great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>in peace and war—Gen. James Shields. This remarkable man
climbed to fame by half a dozen various paths. He was the hero of
two wars, a judge of the Illinois Supreme Court, a governor of Oregon,
and the only American who has had the honor of representing
three states in the United States Senate. Like Jackson, he was gentle
and chivalrous in private life, and an incarnate fury on the field
of battle. His whole career was one of romantic knight errantry
and adventure. He was a wit and a maker of epigrams. One of his
happiest replies was on one occasion when he was asked to name his
greatest victory.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My greatest victory,” he answered quickly, “was won on the day
when my sweetheart, Mary Carr, said ‘Yes.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>After the terrible famine caused by the failure of the potato crop
in 1845 and the following years, the Irish poured into America in
mighty hosts. Since that time more than four millions have arrived
here, ready with Celtic buoyancy for the battle of life in a new land,
and yet almost heart-broken to leave the green fields of their fathers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it hard to die, Barney?” asked a friend of a dying Irishman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is,” replied Barney; “but not so hard as it was to leave Ireland.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But they went to work with a laugh and an “Irish hurrah.”
Whether they knew it or not, they had arrived when they were most
needed. The era of railroads and steamships had begun. Great
cities were being built and being rebuilt. The factory system was
being established in New England. The iron and steel trade had
secured a solid foothold. And so, while the Irish had nothing to
offer at first but labor, labor was what the United States was most
urgently in need of at that stage of its development.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Civil War put American manhood to the test the Irish
were everywhere—in the thickets of the Wilderness, at the Bloody
Angle of Gettysburg, on the crimson field of Chancellorsville.
Standing for state rights—the rights of which John C. Calhoun had
been the great exponent—were Gen. Patrick R. Cleburne, Senator
Regan, the Texan, and others. Standing for the Union were Sheridan,
Meade and Meagher, whose dashing valor is one of our national
boasts. Unquestionably “Little Phil” Sheridan deserves a high
place, not only among American generals, but among the foremost
military commanders of the world. Today, among the retired veterans
of the United States Army there are three brigadier-generals of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Irish birth—Richard Comba, John J. Coppinger and William Quinton.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
There is also one rear-admiral—Joseph Trilley.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. To these three should be added: Brig. Gen. Bernard J. D. Irwin, Brig. Gen. Michael
Cooney, Brig. Gen. James W. Scully, Brig. Gen. Charles P. Eagan, Brig. Gen. William
E. Dougherty, Brig. Gen. John R. McGinness and Brig. Gen. John J. O’Connell, all natives
of Ireland.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For more than two hundred years the sons of Ireland have been
among the pathfinders who prepared the way for the American
nation in its mighty sweep from the Atlantic to the Pacific. No
region has ever been too remote or perilous to daunt the Irish pioneer.
Whoever discovers the North Pole will no doubt find a Kelly or an
O’Brien already on the spot. It was Capt. John J. Healy, for
instance, who was the commercial discoverer of Alaska; and when
the United States first took possession of that frozen country, four
of the sixteen white men in its largest settlement were found to be
subscribers to the <cite>Irish World</cite>. Gen. Patrick E. Connor was a trail-maker
in Utah, as Philip Nolan and Sam Houston were in Texas.
Henry W. Oliver, the late steel king of Pittsburg, who had the most
dramatic career of ups and downs that western Pennsylvania has ever
known, was the first Pittsburgher to realize fully the value of the
Lake Superior iron ore. In consequence, he piled up a forty-million
fortune. Missouri had Brian Mullanphy, who left a fortune for the
assistance of poor immigrants. In fact, when the history of any
western state is written, it will be found that among the army that
cleared the way there was always an Irish brigade.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plain, straight truth about the Western Irish is more wonderful
than any fanciful tale woven in the loom of Arabian imagination.
Talk about <cite>Monte Cristo</cite> or <cite>Sinbad the Sailor</cite>! They are paltry
adventurers compared with men like John W. Mackay or Marcus
Daly. With his three partners, also Irish—James C. Flood, James
G. Fair and William S. O’Brien—John W. Mackay changed the silver
markets of the world. Within a comparatively few years these
four men took a treasure of $150,000,000 from one hole in the side
of a Nevada mountain—the famous Comstock lode. Always ready
for big enterprises, Mackay put his millions behind James Gordon
Bennett’s dream to link America and Europe together by an Atlantic
cable, and drove the scheme ahead to complete success. What Marcus
Daly did in Montana was different only in detail. He, too,
“grasped the skirts of happy chance” with a grip that landed him
and his friends among the most powerful money kings of his generation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>All five of these Irishmen began at the lowest rung of the ladder.
They made themselves the leaders in a country of strong and daring
men, by being the strongest and most daring of all. And today their
children have linked their fathers’ names by marriage with some of
the proudest families in the older states—the Oelrichses, Vanderbilts,
Duers and Girards, as well as to the princely Colonnas of Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether it is the versatile genius of the Emmets of New York; or
the fighting pluck of “Bucky” O’Neil, who was killed with the
Rough Riders at Santiago; or the sagacity of John Mitchell, who is
the leader of 150,000 miners—whether it is the sheer brain force and
inventiveness of a Fulton, a Morse or a McCormick, or the quaint
and witty wisdom of “Mr. Dooley,” there have always been qualities
of the Irish head and the Irish heart that brought honor to the little
home-land of the Celt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is nothing negative about the Irish,” said Patrick Ford—which
is exactly what anyone who knows the rugged old journalist
would have expected him to say. They may be on the wrong side of
the quarrel, but one thing is always certain—they are never on the
fence. They care little or nothing for obstacles and adverse circumstances.
They are the best of friends and the best of enemies—the
quickest with either the open hand or the fist—the most loyal to a
cause and the most rebellious against a tyranny. They live closest
to hope and farthest from despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why,” said Maurice Healy, an Alaskan fur trader, “I’m only 700
miles from a bank!”</p>

<p class='c007'>You can bend and twist an Irishman, but you can seldom break
him—the records of insanity and suicide prove this. He “works
hard in time of peace and fights hard in time of war,” as President
Roosevelt has said. Impulsive, daring, constructive, indomitable, the
Irishman has done indispensable work in this land of his choice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“May his shadow never grow less!”—so say we all.</p>

    again come to the front, we           would repeat the suggestion made by us a couple of
             years ago to the American-Irish Historical Society, that           in no
    possible way could it so promote the objects for           which it is organized as by
    the preparation of a popular           text-book of the history of the race in America,
    suitable           for the use of schools. The Society has the material           for
    doing this; it could do it without loss to itself, and           with great profit to the
    race, which it would thus have           put under a debt of gratitude.”

    <dd>Death of Gen. M. T. McMahon at his home in New           York City. He was a judge of the
    New York Court           of General Sessions at the time of his death. He had
    practised law in New York for many years and was a           fine speaker, but he was
    known chiefly as a soldier. He           was educated at St. John’s College, Fordham,
    from           which he graduated in 1855, and then went to Buffalo, <span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>
    where he studied law in the office of Eli Cook, then          mayor of the city, in
    company with Grover Cleveland,          since president of the United States. Although
    able to          pass the examination, he was too young to be admitted          to the
    bar, and he became a correspondence clerk in the          general post-office at
    Washington. In President Buchanan’s          administration he was appointed special
    post-office          agent to the Pacific coast. He was admitted to          the bar at
    Sacramento in 1861. At the first call for          troops at the breaking out of the
    Civil War he raised          the first company of cavalry on the Pacific. He was
    elected captain of the company, but when it was decided          that the company should
    not go to the front he resigned          and went to Washington. He was made a captain in
             the regular army and an aide-de-camp to Gen. George          B. McClellan, whose
    bosom friend he remained until          “Little Mac’s” death. He served in every
    engagement          in which the Army of the Potomac took part. When          the Sixth
    Corps was disbanded he was adjutant-general          and chief of staff. He also served
    under Generals          Franklin, Sedgwick (who was killed at the Wilderness),
    Baldy Smith and Wright. He received the congressional          medal of honor for bravery
    at the battle of White          Oak Swamp. Congress also presented him with a jeweled
         sword for conspicuous bravery at Spottsylvania and          other battles. At the
    close of the war he was assigned          as adjutant-general under General Dix, to the
    Department          of the East. He resigned in 1866 and became corporation
    attorney of New York City. President Johnson          made him minister to Paraguay. In
    1879 he ran          for Congress against Robert B. Roosevelt and was defeated.
    Two years later he was appointed receiver of          taxes by Andrew H. Green, then
    comptroller. He was          United States marshal for the Southern District of New
       York under President Cleveland. After that he was          an assemblyman and a state
    senator. For years he had          been one of the managers of the National Home for
        Disabled Volunteer Soldiers. In 1896 he was elected          judge of the Court of
    General Sessions. General McMahon <span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>          was a Fenian and was ready for
    service in Ireland.           He was also a member of the Clan-na-Gael in           its
    earlier days. His brother, John E. McMahon, who           was attorney-general and
    adjutant-general of New York           state under Governor Seymour, was colonel of the
    One           Hundred and Sixty-fourth New York Volunteers, which           he raised in
    Buffalo at the outbreak of the war. The           regiment was later consolidated with
    the Phœnix Zouaves,           a Fenian regiment, and McMahon became colonel.           It
    was part of the Corcoran Legion. Col. John E. McMahon           was killed at the siege
    of Suffolk, Va., in 1863.           The other brother, James P. McMahon, was a captain
           in the Sixty-ninth with Thomas Francis Meagher, later           became
    lieutenant-colonel of the One Hundred and           Fifty-fifth New York, and was
    promoted to be colonel           of the One Hundred and Sixty-fourth New York, in
      place of his brother, Martin. He remained in command           of the latter regiment
    until he was killed in a charge at           the battle of Cold Harbor on June 3, 1864.

    <dd>An editorial in the <cite>New Century</cite>, Washington, D. C.,           this date,
    says: “As an individual contributor to the San           Francisco relief fund, one
    notices an Irish name leading           all the rest—far and above in amount, the
    generosity of           the Rockefellers, the Astors and the Vanderbilts. The <span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>
             name is that of James D. Phelan, who subscribed $1,000,000.            And this,
    notwithstanding that he himself            lost $15,000,000 by the fire. These great
    catastrophes            always evoke large-hearted acts and assure us that
    neither magnanimity, public spirit nor courage have            yet vanished from the face
    of the earth. Mr. Phelan’s            conduct proclaims him a man worthy of his wealth.
    We            learn, further, that he is a Catholic, a graduate of a            Jesuit
    college and that he was mayor of San Francisco            from 1896 to 1902. As he is
    only forty-five years of            age, we shall hope to hear more of him hereafter.”

    <dd>The New York <cite>Irish-American</cite> for this week has the            following
    relative to our San Francisco member, ex-Mayor            James D. Phelan: “In San
    Francisco the man            of the hour in whose hands is the management of the
      great relief fund, and under whose executive direction            the important
    movements that are to lift the stricken            city up from the depths and rebuild
    her shattered fortunes            have already been begun, is that well-known
    Irish-American,            James D. Phelan, former mayor of the city.            Although
    his personal and business losses must reach            millions, it is reported that he
    has devoted the sum of            $1,000,000 out of his private fortune to employ the
           afflicted laboring people of his native city. Mr. Phelan,            whose father
    was one of the men who made San Francisco <span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>          rich and famous, was born
    in 1861, and was educated           at St. Ignatius College, in that city, where he
        graduated with honor, after a four years’ course of           study. He then entered
    as a student at the law department           of the University of California, of which he
    is           also a graduate. He was selected mayor of the city, as           a Democrat,
    in 1896, and served until 1902. His           régime was marked by zeal and ability in
    the public           service. The Democrats of the state Legislature complimented
      him with their nomination for United States           senator a few years ago. He is
    one of the leading capitalists           of the United States, and has numerous
    commercial           and mining interests. He is president of the Mutual
    Savings Bank and the finest business block in San Francisco,           situated on Market
    Street, bore his name. It           withstood the shock of earthquake, but the resulting
    fire           reduced it to a mass of smoking ruins. Mr. Phelan has           been for
    years a generous supporter of the Irish cause           and has stood by both Parnell and
    Redmond with his           influence and his money. His father aided in receiving
      Terence Bellew McManus, John Mitchel and Thomas           Francis Meagher when those
    patriots escaped from the           British penal settlements in Australia and sought
    liberty           and new careers in America. No city has been more           generous in
    aid of Ireland than San Francisco and its           people, of all races, are renowned
    for their hospitality           and liberality, and foremost among those who offered
         that hospitality has always been James D. Phelan. In           the new city that is
    to rise triumphant from the ashes           of the present disaster his grateful
    fellow-citizens will           no doubt give him every honor in their bestowal.”

    marking the burial place of           those who fell in the Boston massacre of March 5,
    1770,           and of a boy who was killed on the previous February <span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>
    22. The modest slab of slate is in keeping with the           other memorials in this
    historic burying ground. It was           erected by Boston Chapter, S. A. R., and is the
    first permanent           marker that has been placed over these graves.           Dr.
    Samuel Crowell, president of the Boston Chapter,           unveiled the slab with a brief
    introductory speech, presenting           Dr. Moses Greeley Parker of Lowell, president
            of the Massachusetts Society, who congratulated Boston           Chapter on the
    work it has done and is doing. Edward           W. McGlenen, city registrar, of the
    committee, gave a           brief historical sketch of the events leading up to the
        massacre, including the shooting of the boy, Christopher           Snider, by the
    British soldiers, who fired into his father’s           house. Little attention has been

    first           victim of the struggles between the colonists and the           crown.”
    The slab stands close to the grave of Samuel           Adams and is in plain view from

    <dd>Death of Hon. Michael J. Sullivan, a member of the           executive council of the
    governor of Massachusetts, at           his home in Boston. He worked his way through the
              Boston University Law School and continued his legal           studies in the
    office of the Hon. Patrick A. Collins,           afterwards mayor, and was in July, 1898,
    admitted to           the bar. He was elected a member of the Massachusetts
    House of Representatives in 1898, and re-elected           in 1899. He served on the
    important committee of           metropolitan affairs and represented Mayor Collins on
           that committee, looking after the interests of the City           of Boston. He
    was a candidate for the state Senate in           1900, but was defeated. In the
    following year he was           chosen a member of that body, and re-elected in 1902.
          He was a member of the governor’s council in 1904,           1905 and the present
    year. Governors Bates, Douglas           and Guild, in whose councils Mr. Sullivan
    served, had           high admiration for him. In June, 1905, he was in           charge,
    officially, of the Massachusetts delegation to the           Lewis and Clark Exposition
    in Portland, Ore. The           state was represented at the funeral by Governor Guild,
            Lieutenant-Governor Draper and members of the executive           council, Senate
    and House, and the city by Mayor           Fitzgerald and members of the board of

<p class='c006'>The following members of the Society died during the year 1906,
much and deservedly regretted:</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Coffey, John J.</span>, born in County Kerry, Ireland, 1831; died at Neponset (Boston),
Mass., June 13, 1906. He enlisted for service in the Civil War on
December 13, 1861, in Company C, Twenty-eighth Massachusetts Regiment
(the famous Faugh-a-Ballaghs), which formed part of Meagher’s
Irish Brigade, and he later fought with the Fourth Heavy Artillery of
Massachusetts. Among the famous battles in which he took part were
Marye’s Heights, Gettysburg and Fredericksburg. He was stricken with
rheumatic fever, which necessitated his taking furloughs. With the exception
of these two absences he served from the first year of the war until
its conclusion, and was in the army which assembled in Washington for
review preparatory to its disbandment at the close of hostilities. He
returned to Boston after the war, and was active in military organizations.
He joined the Montgomery Light Guard Veteran Association and various
other Irish societies. He was a most patriotic man and an active worker
in the interests of his native land. He was identified with the Irish
National League, Irish National Federation and the United Irish League.
He also belonged to Division 43, A. O. H., the Knights of St. Brendan
and John A. Andrew Post, No. 5, G. A. R. He is survived by his wife
and six children: James D. and Timothy J. Coffey of Boston; Charles M.
Coffey, who has been in the West and Alaska for some years, part of the
time serving in the United States Cavalry; Mrs. George G. White of
Dorchester, Mass.; Mrs. William H. Murphy of Neponset; and Miss
Anna S. Coffey, a teacher in the Henry L. Pierce School, Dorchester, who
lived with her parents. When a collection of articles for an Irish-American
loan exhibition for the World’s fair at St. Louis, Mo., was being gotten
up in 1904, John J. Coffey, the subject of this obituary, contributed
an Irish flag that had been carried during the Civil War by the Twenty-eighth
Massachusetts. Accompanying the flag, he sent a letter, the following
being an extract therefrom: “This flag has a precious history. It
was presented to the Twenty-eighth Regiment, through the late Patrick
Donahoe, by the Irish women of Boston, on Sept. 24, 1861, at the same
time Governor Andrew presented the regiment with the flag of the State
of Massachusetts. My company (C) was selected as the right center or
color company, and my brother, Michael J., whose height exceeded mine
by two inches, was selected as color sergeant of this green flag, and carried
it until he fell mortally wounded at the second battle of Bull Run,
August 30, 1862; after that it went through Chantilly, South Mountain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>and Antietam. On the memorable day of the attack on Marye’s Heights,
at Fredericksburg, it was the only green flag unfurled—and by this I do
not intend to cast any reflections on the other four regiments of the Irish
Brigade. Some time before Chancellorsville, in May following, Colonel
Byrnes and the other officers of the regiment concluded that it was too
cumbersome, subscribed among themselves and procured a flag of lighter
fabric (worsted), and laid the old flag (this one) aside, but in safe keeping,
and you may rest assured that it has been scrupulously cared for and
treasured by the custodian.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Coleman, James S.</span>, builder of the new Croton Dam, New York, and street
cleaning commissioner from 1881 to 1891, died at his home, 38 East 69th
Street, New York City, December 17. Deceased was one of the best-known
contractors in this country. At the time of his appointment as
commissioner of street cleaning by Mayor Grace of New York he was
engaged in the construction of the Texas and Pacific Railroad, which work
was turned over to other contractors, while deceased gave his whole time
to the study of his work for the city. He was the first commissioner to
realize the many commercial uses to which city waste might be put, and
he so arranged the disposal of garbage as to clear for the city $90,000
yearly. Mayor Grace appointed him to a six-year term, which continued
through the term of Mayor Edson, and subsequently he was re-appointed
for another six-year term by Mayor Hewitt. In 1892 he received the contract
for the building of the new Croton Dam, and shortly before his
death the entire work was completed. Deceased was born about sixty-three
years ago. He came of a family of contractors, his father having
engaged in that business until his death. He spent his boyhood in Madison,
N. J. Deceased was prominent in charitable work of an unobtrusive
sort and was a member of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American
Geographical Society and the Manhattan, Catholic and Hardware clubs,
Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, and was a member of the board of managers
of the Catholic Orphan Asylum. Funeral services were held at St. Patrick’s
Cathedral.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Curry, Capt. Patrick S.</span>, born in Ireland; died in Nashua, N. H., April 7,
1906. He came to this country when a young man, eventually settling in
Lynn, Mass., where he was long engaged in the granite business. During
the Civil War he rose from the ranks to command Companies C and G
of the Third Massachusetts Cavalry, under Banks and Sheridan. He was
one of the volunteers at the storming of Port Hudson, and for his bravery
there was given a medal by Congress. During the siege of Baton Rouge
he was made provost marshal at that place. He was wounded several
times. In 1883 he was elected representative to the Massachusetts General
Court from Lynn, and was the author of the free text-book bill. He
also presented the bill abolishing contract labor in prisons. At the time
of his death he was superintending the construction of a new post-office
building in Nashua, N. H.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span><span class='sc'>Davis, Hon. Robert T.</span> (M. D.), born in County Down, Ireland, 1823; died
in Fall River, Mass., October 29, 1906. He was the son of John and
Sarah (Thompson) Davis. His father was a Presbyterian and his mother
a member of the Society of Friends. They came to America in 1826 and
settled in Amesbury, Mass. Doctor Davis was educated in the Friends’
School at Providence, R. I., and at Amesbury Academy, and began the
study of medicine with Dr. Thomas Wilbur, well remembered as a leading
physician in Fall River. He passed two years at Tremont Medical School
in Boston and was graduated from the medical department of Harvard
in 1847. In 1850 he went to Fall River and began the practice of his
profession, winning a high rank as a skillful physician. When a young
man he was active in the anti-slavery movement and in 1851 made a
speech in favor of instructing the local representatives to vote for Charles
Sumner for United States senator. He was a member of the state constitutional
convention in 1853, and in 1858 and 1861 was a state senator. He
was a member of the national Republican convention which nominated
Abraham Lincoln in 1860, and also in 1876 when Rutherford B. Hayes
was nominated. At the request of Governor Andrew of Massachusetts,
he introduced the resolution for the appointment of peace commissioners
to attend a convention in Washington in an endeavor to preserve peace
between the North and the South. During the early days of the Civil
War he assisted in the formation of the Seventh Massachusetts Regiment,
intending to accompany them to the front as surgeon, but gave way to a
relative of the colonel of the regiment, who was desirous of securing the
appointment. He was later appointed by Governor Andrew medical examiner
of recruits for his district, and later examiner of applicants for
exemption from military duty on account of physical disability. He was
one of the three local surgeons who, in obedience to a call from Washington,
after the second battle of Bull Run, went to Alexandria and assisted
in treating the wounded. In 1863 Governor Andrew appointed him a
member of the State Board of Charities, and in 1869 he was appointed a
member of the State Board of Health by Governor Claflin, and when the
two boards were consolidated he was appointed as a member of the new
board by Governor Talbot. In 1873 he was elected mayor of Fall River
without opposition, and at the close of his term he donated his salary to
the Children’s Home. He was elected to Congress in 1882 and re-elected
in 1884 and 1886 and was afterwards appointed by Gov. Oliver Ames a
member of the Metropolitan Sewerage Commission. Doctor Davis in his
long life had been prominent and successful in so many different fields
that his early life as a physician and politician had been in a sense forgotten
by the present generation. During the Land League and other
Irish movements, Doctor Davis was always generous in support of Home
Rule principles, and he had frequently been heard making eloquent and
appealing pleas for the freedom of his native land. He was identified
with the business interests of Fall River as a large owner of real estate
and as one of the largest holders of mill stock in the city. He held large
blocks of stock in a number of the mills, preferring to invest so as to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>a dominant factor in the corporation in which he was interested. Doctor
Davis held many offices in the corporations of the city. He was a director
and also president of the Algonquin Printing Company, the Stafford mills
and the Wampanoag mills. He was also a director in the Davis mills, the
Merchants’ mills and the Stevens Manufacturing Company. He had been
president of the Fall River board of trade, the Union Hospital Corporation
and the Home Market Club. Doctor Davis married, in 1848, Sarah
Congdon Wilbur, daughter of Dr. Thomas Wilbur of Fall River, who died
in 1856, and in 1862 he married Susan A. Haight, daughter of Moses
Haight of Westchester County, New York, who passed away a few years
ago. He is survived by one son, Robert C. Davis of the law firm of
Jackson, Slade &amp; Borden.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Doogue, William</span>, born in Queen’s County, Ireland, 1828; died in Dorchester
(Boston), Mass., November 2, 1906; superintendent of public grounds,
Boston, Mass. When a lad his family emigrated, settling in Middletown,
Conn. Here Mr. Doogue was educated in the local schools, having in his
native country received primary instruction at a private school. At the
age of seventeen he was apprenticed to Affleck, Whitmore &amp; Co., of Hartford,
Conn., who operated one of the most extensive nursery and greenhouse
plants in New England at the time. Here he learned the science
of floriculture, horticulture and landscape gardening. He served five
years with this firm, and during the last three years of his apprenticeship
studied botany under the tuition of Professor Comstock of Trinity College,
a well-known writer on that subject. After the death of Mr. Affleck,
Mr. Doogue became a partner in the firm, the style of which was changed
to that of Whitmore &amp; Co. In 1865 Mr. Doogue dissolved his connection
with the firm and came to Boston. He assumed the entire management
of the floricultural and horticultural business of Charles Copeland in
Boston and Melrose, Mass. Later he established himself in business as a
florist and was most successful. In 1871 Mr. Doogue’s skill was fittingly
recognized when he was chosen to lay out the grounds of the Centennial
Exposition held in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, and make a tropical
and sub-tropical display. He did splendid work and was highly complimented,
and as a reward was presented with two gold and two silver
medals and diplomas. Mr. Doogue transformed the Boston Public Garden
from a place of a few monotonous floral displays during the summer
season, to one of a succession of brilliant, attractive and artistic flowering
and rare plants and exotics, which have been the delight of visitors. He
propagated many of the most rare and costly plants and bulbs, and accumulated
stocks of these and other products of the greenhouse and nursery,
which are today worth in money much more than the whole plant has
cost the city. It may be said he created the department of public grounds,
for when he took charge of it it was only a name, a title; now it is a
substantial and creditable asset of the city, as well as a fitting monument
to the genius and memory of William Doogue. Mr. Doogue was liberal,
but unostentatious in his contributions to works of religion and charity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>His aid to the Home for Destitute Catholic Children and St. Mary’s
Infant Asylum, Dorchester, is remembered with gratitude by the Sisters
having charge of those institutions. He leaves five children, Mrs. Timothy
McCarthy, Mrs. D. H. Sullivan, Mrs. John O’Connell and Luke J. and
William J. Doogue. The funeral of Mr. Doogue took place from the
Church of the Immaculate Conception, Boston, in which for years he had
been a faithful worshipper. In the congregation were Mayor Fitzgerald,
ex-Mayor T. N. Hart, city officials and representatives of organizations
of which Mr. Doogue was a member. Interment was at Middletown,
Conn.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Kenedy, P. J.</span>, born in New York City, 1843; died there January 4, 1906.
He was educated at the Christian Brothers’ School in Canal Street, New
York. Being brought up in the book business, he assisted his father in
his stores in Centre Street and in Mott Street and Barclay Street. On
his father’s death, Mr. Kenedy succeeded to the business, and so well
did it develop that he soon took over the entire building at No. 5 Barclay
Street, which in time became the most extensive Catholic publishing house
in the country. A few years ago he took two of his sons into the firm
with him, and they will continue the business, the foundation of which
their grandfather, John Kenedy, laid eighty years ago. In the fall of
1895, Pope Leo XIII made Mr. Kenedy a publisher to the Holy See, in
New York. He leaves a widow, three sons and four daughters.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Moore, Col. O’Brien</span>, born in Ireland; died in Tucson, Ariz., August 26, 1906.
A life member of the Society. At the time of his death he was general
manager of the Citizen Printing and Publishing Co., Tucson, controlling
a valuable newspaper plant and issuing a daily and weekly. He was a
man of great brilliancy. On the breaking out of the war with Spain,
he entered the service as lieutenant-colonel of the Second West Virginia
Infantry. After a year’s service, and peace being declared with Spain, he
became lieutenant-colonel of United States Volunteers for the operations
in the Philippines, where he served for eighteen months, until his regiment
was mustered out. He then settled in Tucson. He was a newspaper
man of much ability and experience. Some of his early newspaper
career was spent in Houston, Tex., on the <cite>Post</cite>, of which journal he
became managing editor. He was later managing editor of the St. Louis
<cite>Republic</cite>, and was also Washington correspondent for that paper at Washington,
D. C.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>McCall, John A.</span>, born in Albany, N. Y., 1849; died at Lakewood, N. J.,
February 18, 1906. He became clerk in the Albany State Currency Assorting
House; was later in the service of the Connecticut Mutual Life
Insurance Co. until 1869; served in the New York state insurance department
as clerk, 1869–’76; was deputy superintendent, 1876–’83; superintendent
of insurance of New York, 1883–’86; comptroller Equitable Life
Assurance Society, 1887–’92, and was later president of the New York
Life Insurance Co. He was a life member of the Society.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span><span class='sc'>O’Flynn, Rev. Denis P.</span>, born in County Cork, Ireland, 1847; died in New
York City, August 22, 1906. He was educated at St. Colman’s College,
Fermoy, and then spent two years in study in Paris. He entered Louvain
University, Belgium, and obtained the degree of doctor of theology.
Returning to Paris, he was ordained to the priesthood and then came to
America. He was eventually made vicar apostolic to the Bahamas. He
became rector of St. Mary’s Church, Saugerties, N. Y., and for fifteen
years, up to the time of his death, was rector of St. Joseph’s Church, New
York City.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Quinlan, Col. James</span>, born in Ireland, 1843; died in New York City, August
29, 1906. He came to this country when he was but seventeen years of
age. He became a first lieutenant in the Sixty-ninth New York Regiment,
and, in 1861, went with it to Washington, D. C. He was mustered out

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Sullivan, Patrick F.</span>, born in County Kerry, Ireland; died in Boston, Mass.,
July 18, 1906. He came to Boston, Mass., when he was about sixteen
years of age. Obtaining employment in a clothing store at the North
End, his first venture in life’s struggle was made. Later he took a
position with the house of Leonard &amp; Co., brokers in furniture and auctioneers.
Succeeding years found him connected with Libbie, dealer in
rare books, and he continued in this business under the title of Sullivan
Bros. &amp; Libbie until the early eighties, when he took premises in School
Street, Boston, under the name Sullivan &amp; McDonald, and later Sullivan
Brothers, auctioneers. As one of the principal assessors of the City of
Boston, he established a reputation for skill and judgment which caused
his opinion to be sought and followed without hesitation. His generous,
charitable nature and his devotion to religion, as well as his broad, practical
mind, is shown in the following disposition of his fortune in public
benefactions. By the first clause of the will, the testator gives to his sister,
Catherine A. Sullivan, $30,000 as a preferred legacy, and then the following
bequests are made: To the Catholic University of America, $5,000;
to the trustees of Boston College in Boston, $5,000; to St. John’s Ecclesiastical
Seminary, Brighton, $5,000; to the trustees of the Boston Public
Library, to be expended for the purchase of Catholic standard books,
approved by the archbishop of Boston, or by the president of Boston
College, $5,000; to the Little Sisters of the Poor on Dudley Street,
Roxbury, Mass., $5,000; to the House of the Good Shepherd, Boston,
$5,000; Carney Hospital, in memory of Thomas F. Sullivan, deceased
brother of the testator, $5,000; to St. Mary’s Infant Asylum and lying-in
hospital, Dorchester, $5,000; to the Free Home for Consumptives, Quincy
Street, Dorchester, $5,000; Society for Propagation of the Faith, $3,500;
to particular council of St. Vincent de Paul Society, to be distributed

in carrying on religious missions among the Indians, $1,500; to Cardinal
Gibbons, to aid in carrying on religious missions among colored people
of this country, $1,500; to the Conference of St. Vincent de Paul connected
with Church of All Saints, Center Street, Boston, $500; to the
pastor of All Saints’ Church of Center Street, to aid in paying off the
debt on said church, $1,500; to Conference of St. Vincent de Paul connected
with Cathedral of Holy Cross in Boston, $500; to the St. Vincent
Orphan Asylum, Camden Street, Boston, $2,000; to the Working Boys’
Home, Boston, $2,000; to House of Angel Guardian on Vernon Street,

to Appomatox and Lee’s surrender, and was transferred June 5, 1865, to

Cavan, Ireland, 1842; came to this country when he was but ten years of
age, and spent much of his youth at East Dennis, Cape Cod, Mass. His
early love for the sea was gratified later in life when he became captain
of some of the finest deep-water ships sailing from Baltimore, Boston and
elsewhere. His first command was the bark <em>May Queen</em>, a regular Baltimore
and Rio packet, 1872. He then had command of the ship Pilgrim
of Boston, and made several voyages to the East Indies. In 1884 he was
given command of the <em>Charger</em>, a larger and finer ship than the <em>Pilgrim</em>,
and sailed to ports in Japan. He next had command of the <em>South American</em>,
“the Commodore’s ship,” of the Hastings fleet (Boston), and took
her to Australia and other parts. He made several record voyages during
his career, and some of these records still stand, having never been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>equalled. On one occasion he was wrecked off the coast of Africa; he
and his wife upon being rescued were hospitably entertained by the Boers
of the adjacent country. Returning to East Dennis, Mass., his wife’s
health became poor and so he removed with her to Coronado, Cal., hoping
that the change of climate would benefit her, but she died in 1901. She
had accompanied her husband on several of his voyages, and had with him
visited many parts of the world. Captain Connolly has written much and
entertainingly. He has at present in manuscript form a novel of ocean
life entitled <cite>The Magic of the Sea</cite>.</p>

<p class='c018'><b>Doyle, John F.</b>, of John F. Doyle &amp; Sons, 45 William Street, New York
City. (Life member of the Society.) Mr. Doyle is the senior member
of the real estate firm of John F. Doyle &amp; Sons. He was born in New
York City, 1837, a son of James Doyle who participated in the Irish revolution
of 1798 and who came to the United States early in 1806. This
James Doyle, the immigrant, had a son who was killed in the Florida
war of 1837, and a grandson who fell in 1861, fighting for the Union.
John F. Doyle, the subject of this sketch and member of the Society,
entered the law office of Alexander Hamilton, grandson of the first secretary
of the treasury, afterwards the firm of Hamilton, Rives &amp; Rogers,
and remained with them from 1853 to 1869, in the meantime studying
law and being admitted to the bar in 1862. Alexander Hamilton, Francis
R. Rives, a son of William C. Rives, of Virginia, at one time minister to
France and senator, and Nathaniel Pendleton Rogers, all of the old
Revolutionary stock, were members of the firm. Mr. Doyle’s management
of some Wall Street properties for them at this period became so
conspicuous that he was urged by them to assume the management of
their estates, which he did. Shortly afterwards followed the acquisition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>of the estates of such well-known people as Mrs. Harriet L. Langdon,
granddaughter-in-law of the first John Jacob Astor, John Pyne March,
Mrs. Morgan L. Livingston, George L. Schuyler, James M. Pendleton,
A. Newbold Morris, James H. Jones, John Steward, Jr., Royal Phelps,
deceased, Royal Phelps Carroll, Robert S. Minturn, estate of Gertrude L.
Lowndes, deceased, William H. King, of Newport, R. I., and others too
numerous to mention in detail. A feature of his career as a successful
manager lies in the fact that the business associations and connections
formed by him in the beginning are still held intact. Among the notable
sales made by him are those from William H. Morris to John Jacob
Astor in 1880, conveying 150 acres of lots in the twenty-third ward on
and adjacent to Harlem River; the great sale of South Brooklyn lots at
Gowanus Bay in 1884. Mr. Doyle represents today the same old and well-known
families and estates represented by him fifty-four years ago. During
his career Mr. Doyle has met and done business with some of the
most notable men connected with the families notable in American History,
such as three of the four sons of the first Alexander Hamilton,
Admiral Farragut, Capt. Percival Drayton, Rawlins Lowndes, of South
Carolina, William C. Rives, U. S. senator from Virginia, at one time
minister to France, George L. Schuyler, grandson of Philip Schuyler and
owner of the famous yacht <em>America</em>, Philip Schuyler, his son, Henry
Grinnell of Arctic fame, Robert J. and Mortimer Livingston, Hon. John
Lee Carroll, Commodore Wm. K. Vanderbilt, and scores of others equally
well known, besides representing branches now of four lineal descendants
of signers of the Declaration of Independence. His two sons, Col. John
F. Doyle, Jr., and Alfred L. Doyle, have been with him in business for
years past and all three enjoy an enviable reputation for integrity, ability
and prudence in all their undertakings.</p>

<p class='c018'><b>Hanrahan, John D.</b> (M. D.), Rutland, Vt., a native of County Limerick,
Ireland; was graduated in medicine from the University of the City of
New York, 1867; in June, 1861, he was, on examination (not having
graduated), appointed surgeon in the United States Navy, and served
through the entire Civil War. The vessels on which he served did duty
mostly on the rivers of Virginia and North Carolina, where he served
with the army as well as the navy, thereby having the benefit and experience
of both branches of the service, especially in the surgical line. In
August, 1863, the vessel on which he was serving was captured at the mouth
of the Rappahannock River and all on board made prisoners. They were
taken overland to Richmond where they were confined in Libby Prison.
At that time the Confederates were very short of surgeons and medical
supplies, and he was asked if he would go over to Belle Island and attend
the Union prisoners. After consulting his fellow-prisoners he consented,
and for six weeks he attended the sick and wounded Union prisoners
faithfully, under very great disadvantages, as the appliances were very
limited. After that he was paroled. While a prisoner of war he was
treated with the greatest courtesy and consideration by the medical staff
and officers of the Confederacy. After the close of the war he was settled
in New York City, but for nearly forty years has been a resident of Rutland,
Vt. He was town and city physician of Rutland for many years.
He was appointed surgeon of the Third Vermont Regiment, 1871, by
Governor Stewart; was the first president of the Rutland County Medical
and Surgical Society; has been a director and consulting surgeon of the
Rutland (Vt.) Hospital; consulting surgeon to the Fanny Allen Hospital,
Winooski, Vt.; a member of the Vermont Sanitary Association, and a
member of the Vermont Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis; president
of Rutland Village two years and trustee eight years; county commissioner
one year; president, United States pension examining board four
years under President Cleveland, and president of the same board four
years under President Harrison. He was postmaster of Rutland during
the second term of President Cleveland. He has since its organization
been an active member of the G. A. R.; surgeon of Roberts Post, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>largest in Vermont; has served three terms as medical director of the
Department; served on the staffs of three commanders-in-chief—Veasy,
Palmer and Weissert; a member of Commander-in-Chief Stewart’s staff.
Doctor Hanrahan is the author of several medical papers, has performed
many surgical operations, and has served through several epidemics of
smallpox and diphtheria. He was a delegate to the Democratic National
conventions of 1884, 1888, and chairman of the Vermont delegation to
the National Convention of 1892. Also a delegate to the Democratic
National Convention in St. Louis, 1904, and to the Ancient Order of
Hibernians convention in St. Louis, July 19, 1904.</p>

<p class='c018'><b>Kelly, Eugene</b>, Templecourt Building, New York City.</p>

<p class='c018'><b>Kelly, John Forrest</b> (Ph. D.), Pittsfield, Mass.; born near Carrick-on-Suir,
Ireland. He was educated in Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken,
N. J., received the degree of B. L. in 1878, and that of Ph. D. in 1881.
His first occupation was as assistant to Thomas A. Edison, in Menlo
Park laboratory, his work then principally relating to the chemistry of
rare earths. Late in 1879 Mr. Kelly became electrical engineer of the
New York branch of the Western Electric Company. This was the time
when the telephone was being generally introduced, and when dynamos
were being first applied to telegraphic purposes. In the construction and
installment of instruments for telegraphy and telephones and of such
measuring instruments as were then known, Mr. Kelly received a thorough
training. In 1882 he became laboratory assistant to Edward Weston, then
chief electrician of the United States Electric Lighting Company, and,
with the exception of a year which he spent in connection with the Remingtons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Mr. Kelly continued his association with Mr. Weston until July,
1886. Some of the most important work, such as the research which ended
in the discovery of high resistance alloys of very low or even negative
temperature co-efficients, were substantially carried out by Mr. Kelly under
general directions from Mr. Weston, whom Mr. Kelly succeeded as chief
electrician of the United States Electric Lighting Company, which, in
1889, passed to the Westinghouse interests; but Mr. Kelly retained his
position as chief electrician until January, 1892, when he resigned to join
William Stanley in experimental work. The work done by Mr. Kelly, in
this connection, gave a great impetus to the alternating current business.
Mr. Kelly’s inventive work is partially represented by eighty patents. The
art of building transformers and generators of alternating currents was
revolutionized, and Mr. Kelly and his colleagues were the first to put
polyphase motors into actual commercial service. That success naturally
led to long-distance transmission work, and the first long-distance transmission
plants in California (indeed the first in the world), were undertaken
on Mr. Kelly’s recommendation and advice. He was the first to
make an hysteretically stable steel, a matter of vastly more importance
than the comparatively spectacular transmission work. Mr. Kelly at present
occupies the position of president of the John F. Kelly Engineering
Company, president of the Cokel Company and president of the Telelectric
Company, as well as president of the Conchas River Power Company and
director of the Southwestern Exploration Company. The Cokel Company
is organized to exploit the invention of Mr. E. W. Cooke, by means of
which foodstuffs may be perfectly dehydrated, losing on the average ninety
per cent. in weight. Foods dehydrated by this process, although free from
all chemical preservatives, are entirely stable, and yet preserve their pristine
freshness through extremes of temperature, and when served are
indistinguishable from fresh foods of the ordinary type. The Telelectric
Company is organized for the manufacture of electric piano players, which
are either entirely automatic or entirely controllable at will. Mr. Kelly
was married to Miss Helen Fischer, in New York City, in 1892, and they
have two children—Eoghan and Domnall. Mr. Kelly is a thorough and
unswerving Irish Nationalist, and his splendid generosity to the cause is
well known.</p>

<p class='c018'><b>McGowan, Rear Admiral John</b>, U. S. N. (retired), 1739 N. Street, N. W.,
Washington, D. C. (Life member of the Society.) He was born at Port
Penn, Del., August 4, 1843. He is a son of John and Catherine (Caldwell)
McGowan. He was educated in the public schools of Philadelphia,
Pa., 1848–’53, and in private schools in Elizabeth, N. J., 1854–’59. Entering
the navy, he was appointed acting master’s mate, March 8, 1862;
was promoted to acting master May 8, 1862, and ordered to command
the U. S. S. <em>Wyandank</em> in the Potomac flotilla. He served on the Potomac
and Rappahannock rivers until February, 1863, when he was detached
from the <em>Wyandank</em> and ordered to the <em>Florida</em> as navigator. He served
on the <em>Florida</em> in the blockade off Wilmington, N. C., until October, 1864,
when the ship went to New York for repairs. In November, of the same
year, he was detached from the <em>Florida</em> and ordered to the U. S. S. <em>State
of Georgia</em> as navigator; arrived off Wilmington, N. C., the day after
the capture of Fort Fisher, his ship being then ordered to reinforce the
fleet off Charleston, S. C. While there he took part in the Bulls Bay
Expedition, which was one of the causes of the evacuation of Charleston
by the Confederates. Soon after the evacuation, the <em>State of Georgia</em> was
ordered to Aspinwall (Colon) to protect American interests on the Isthmus
of Panama. Before sailing for Aspinwall, McGowan succeeded
Lieutenant Manly as executive officer of the ship. In November, 1865, he
was ordered to the U. S. S. <em>Monongahela</em> as watch and division officer;
served on the <em>Monongahela</em> in the West Indies until January, 1867, when
he was detached and, a few days later, joined the U. S. S. <em>Tacony</em>, Commander
Roe, fitting out for duty in the Gulf Squadron. He was at Vera
Cruz nearly all the summer of 1867, which witnessed the fall of Maximilian’s
empire. After the death of Maximilian, and the surrender of Vera
Cruz to the Liberals, the <em>Tacony</em> returned to Pensacola, Fla., but yellow
fever breaking out aboard the ship, went to Portsmouth, N. H., where,
after undergoing quarantine, the officers were detached and ordered to
their homes the latter part of September, 1867. In October of the same
year, McGowan was ordered to duty on board the receiving ship at the
Philadelphia navy yard. He commanded the U. S. S. <em>Constellation</em> there,
and was afterward executive officer of the frigate <em>Potomac</em>, also a receiving
ship, at Philadelphia. In March, 1868, while on the <em>Potomac</em>, he received
a commission as master in the regular navy, and in October, 1868, was
ordered to duty with the Asiatic fleet. On reporting to the admiral, he
was ordered to duty as executive officer of the U. S. S. <em>Unadilla</em>; succeeded
to the command of the <em>Unadilla</em> in June, 1869, and in November of
that year was detached from the <em>Unadilla</em> and ordered to the U. S. S.
<em>Iroquois</em>; returned in her to the United States, the ship going out of commission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>in April, 1870. In April, 1870, he was promoted to be lieutenant-commander
and while in that grade served on the double-turreted monitor
<em>Terror</em>, the <em>Wachusetts</em>, <em>Juniata</em> and <em>Marion</em> as executive officer, and at
the League Island, Philadelphia and Brooklyn navy yards. In January,
1887, he was promoted to commander; commanded the <em>Swatara</em>, <em>St. Mary’s</em>,
<em>Portsmouth</em> and <em>Alliance</em>, and was also commandant of the naval training
station at Newport, R. I., from December, 1896, to July, 1899. He was
promoted captain, February, 1899, and in August took command of the
U. S. S. <em>Monadnock</em> at Manila. In November, 1900, he was ordered to
duty as commandant of the naval station at Key West, Fla. In April,
1901, he was detached and ordered before the retiring board. He was
retired, with the rank of rear admiral, in April, 1901. He resides in
Washington, D. C., and is held in very high regard. In October, 1871,
he wedded Evelyn Manderson of Philadelphia. Admiral McGowan is a
member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion, of the Order of Foreign

<p class='c018'><b>Sanders, Col. C. C.</b>, Gainesville, Ga.; president of the State Banking Co.
of Gainesville; alternate commissioner to World’s Fair, Chicago, Ill., 1893;
vice-president for Georgia, American Bankers’ Association. Colonel Sanders
is of Irish and English ancestry. On the maternal side he is descended
from Thomas and Theodosia M. Smyth, who emigrated from Ireland in
1793, landing in Charleston, S. C. They settled in Jones County, Ga.
Thomas died November 28, 1799. On the paternal side Colonel Sanders
is a descendant of Rev. Moses Sanders, who emigrated from England,
with two brothers, John and David, and arrived in Petersburg, Va., 1765.
They embraced the patriotic cause in the Revolution and were active in
operations against the British. Colonel Sanders, the subject of this sketch,
graduated from the Georgia Military Institute, in June, 1861; entered the
Confederate service; was made lieutenant-colonel of the Twenty-fourth
Regiment of Infantry, Georgia Volunteers, August, 1861; served under
General Lee in the Peninsular campaign, in the seven days’ battles around
Richmond, Va., and was among the bravest of the brave; commanded his
regiment at Malvern Hill and at Marye’s Heights, Fredericksburg, where
the Twenty-fourth was a part of the Confederate forces that received the
valorous charges of Meagher’s Irish Brigade. He also commanded the
regiment at the battles of Chancellorsville and Antietam, at which latter
conflict he was placed in command of Wofford’s Brigade. While in this
position he met a bayonet charge from the Federals by a counter bayonet
charge, and in the desperate fighting that ensued, fifty-eight per cent. of
Sanders’ heroic force was swept away. Colonel Sanders also led the
Twenty-fourth at Cedar Creek, Chickamauga, Knoxville, the Wilderness,
Spottsylvania Court House, and Sailor’s Creek. On April 6, 1865, Ewell’s
Corps, to which Colonel Sanders’ regiment was then attached, was captured,
and Colonel Sanders was sent as a prisoner of war to Washington,
D. C. Writing of Meagher’s Irish Brigade, Colonel Sanders says: “I was
in command of the Twenty-fourth Georgia Regiment, with other troops,
at the foot of Marye’s Heights, receiving the five heroic and gallant charges
of the Irish Brigade, whose prodigies of valor have filled the country with
admiration. I saw the devoted Irish charge up to our breastworks, to be
mowed down by a line of Confederate fire that no soldiers could withstand.
I saw the Irish battalions cut down like grain before the reaper,
yet the survivors would magnificently close up their ranks only to have huge
gaps again cut through them. When forced back they rallied and came
bravely on again, only to be riddled with bullets and torn by artillery.
Their fifth charge was made with greatly decimated ranks that slowly
recoiled like the waves of a tempestuous sea. When twilight descended
upon the scene, a spectacle was presented unequaled in warfare. At least
three fourths of my command was composed of men of Irish descent and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>knew that the gallant dead in our front were our kindred of the land
beyond the sea. When, one by one, the stars came out that night, many
tears were shed by Southern Confederate eyes for the heroic Federal Irish
dead.” During the war Colonel Sanders was offered the rank of brigadier-general
but declined the same.</p>

  <h2 id='GENERAL' class='c005'>GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Society was organized on January 20, 1897, in Boston, Mass.,
and now has members in many states, the District of Columbia, one
territory and three foreign countries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Briefly stated, the object of the organization is to make better
known the Irish chapter in American history.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two classes of members in the organization,—Life and
Annual. The life membership fee is $50 (paid once). The fee for
annual members is $5, paid yearly. In the case of new annual members,
the initiation fee, $5, also pays the membership dues for the
first year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The board of government comprises a president-general, a vicepresident-general,
a secretary-general, a treasurer-general, a librarian
and archivist, and an executive council. There are also state vice-presidents.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Society has already issued several bound volumes and a number
of other publications. These have been distributed to the members
and to public libraries; also to historical organizations and to
universities. Each member of the Society is entitled, free of charge,
to a copy of every publication issued from the time of his admittance.
These publications are of great interest and value, and are more than
an equivalent for the membership fee.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Society draws no lines of creed or politics. Being an American
organization in spirit and principle, it welcomes to its ranks
Americans of whatever race descent, and of whatever creed, who take
an interest in the objects for which the Society is organized. Membership
application blanks will be furnished on request.</p>

<p class='c007'>The membership includes many people of prominence, and has
been addressed by many distinguished men. It occupies a position
in the front rank of American historical organizations.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
